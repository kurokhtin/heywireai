George Santos is denying the latest fraud claim against him, saying reports that he orchestrated a credit card scam are untrue. In a sworn statement, first reported by Politico, a former roommate accused Santos of orchestrating a skimming operation in Seattle to steal information from ATM and credit cards. \"I am coming forward today to declare that the person in charge of the crime of credit card fraud when I was arrested was George Santos / Anthony Devolder,\" Gustavo Ribeiro Trelha wrote in a sworn statement, according to Politico. \"Santos voluntarily surrendered two cellphones at the Secret Service's New York field office, where the interview took place,\" CBS News reported, citing two sources familiar with the investigation. During the hearing, Santos can be heard in court audio falsely telling the judge that he was employed at the investment firm Goldman Sachs. The latest report follows a wave of state and federal investigations into Santos, who is facing legal scrutiny and public pressure for lying about his personal and professional biography. The House Ethics Committee last week launched an investigation into whether Santos engaged in \"unlawful activity\" during his campaign and since taking office. Additionally, multiple complaints have been filed with the Federal Election Commission about unanswered questions in Santos' campaign finances.WASHINGTON\u2013Embattled Rep.

The latest accusation comes from a former roommate, Gustavo Ribeiro Trelha, who claims that Santos was in charge of a skimming operation in Seattle to steal information from ATM and credit cards.\n\n\"I am coming forward today to declare that the person in charge of the crime of credit card fraud when I was arrested was George Santos / Anthony Devolder,\" Trelha wrote in a sworn statement, according to Politico. Trelha, who was convicted of fraud and deported to Brazil in 2017, sent the information to the FBI, the U.S. Secret Service office in New York, and the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Eastern District of New York.\n\nHowever, Santos denies all allegations and voluntarily surrendered two cellphones at the Secret Service's New York field office. During the hearing, there was audio of Santos falsely telling the judge that he was employed at the investment firm Goldman Sachs. This latest report follows a wave of state and federal investigations into Santos, who is still facing legal scrutiny and public pressure for lying about his personal and professional biography.\n\nThis is not the first time that Santos has been accused of wrongdoing. Multiple complaints have been filed with the Federal Election Commission about unanswered questions in Santos' campaign finances. The House Ethics Committee has launched an investigation into whether he engaged in \"unlawful activity\" during his campaign and since taking office.\n\nSantos has a history of lying, ranging from saying that he was a volleyball star and graduated from a college he never attended to work experience and a crafted Jewish ancestry. Many have accused him of being a \"sick puppy\" and a \"sociopath.\"\n\n\"What we're dealing with here is a man who has no sense of morality or decency,\" said Republican senator Mitt Romney on Twitter. \"George Santos is a fraud and a liar.\"\n\nDespite the mounting evidence against him, Santos continues to deny any wrongdoing. His supporters have taken to Twitter to defend him, claiming that the accusations are all politically motivated.\n\nThe situation has caused tension in Congress, with many lawmakers calling for Santos' resignation. \"We cannot have someone who is so clearly untrustworthy as a member of Congress,\" said Candy Woodall, a Republican from Florida.\n\nThe House Ethics Committee investigation will continue, and many are hoping for a swift resolution to this scandal involving ATM scams and credit card skimming. Until then, the allegations against George Santos will continue to hang over his head, damaging his reputation and potentially ending his political career."]]}
