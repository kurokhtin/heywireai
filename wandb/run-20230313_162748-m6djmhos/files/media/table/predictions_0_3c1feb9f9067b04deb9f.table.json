The missed payment triggers a 30-day grace period on its debt agreements, sources say, and talks are expected to lead to a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing next week. \n\nThe missed payment amounts to $31 million, according to a source familiar with the matter. This would represent a significant chunk of the Diamondbacks' payroll, which makes up only a fraction of the regional sports TV payments owed to various MLB, NBA and NHL teams by Diamond Sports. The broadcaster owns the rights to local broadcasts for the Atlanta Braves, Cincinnati Reds and Minnesota Twins, among other teams. \n\n\u201cDiamond Sports continues to pay all broadcasting rights fees owed to our teams,\u201d the company said in a statement to Reuters on March 9. \u201cWe are committed to resolving payments to the Arizona Diamondbacks.\u201d\n\nDiamond Sports had said last month that it had missed a $140 million payment due to its lenders. Regional sports broadcasts were once seen as a prized offering in cable TV packages, especially since exclusive pay TV deals guarantee teams such as the Diamondbacks extra income from extended markets. \n\nHowever, with customers cutting the cord and relying more on streaming media, the business model for regional sports broadcasts has become increasingly unsustainable. The failure of Diamond Sports to make its payment to the Diamondbacks is only the latest sign of the industry\u2019s struggle. \n\nMLB and Diamond Sports have both said that the company's financial constraints will not impact broadcasts for the baseball season that opens March 30. Still, the missed payment could have significant ramifications for the Diamondbacks and other teams. \n\nIn response to a Reuters request for comment on the possible bankruptcy, Diamond Sports and MLB have both said that the company's financial constraints will not impact broadcasts for the baseball season that opens March 30. \n\nReporting by Dietrich.Knauth@thomsonreuters.com, Editing by Alexia Garamfalvi and Aurora Ellis.\n\nTitle: US Regional Sports Broadcaster Misses Payment to Arizona Diamondbacks, Signaling Bankruptcy Near."]]}
