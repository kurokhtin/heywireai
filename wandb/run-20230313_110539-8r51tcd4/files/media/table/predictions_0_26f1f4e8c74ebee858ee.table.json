He scored just eight points in L.A.'s win over the Toronto Raptors on Friday, and although he was better versus the Knicks, he still didn't do enough. He shot 8-of-18 and missed four of his five free throws, which was a significant factor in his team's defeat and caused Bayless to blame him for the Lakers' inability to get the job done.

The Knicks fronted him, swarmed him with defenders and didn't allow him to become entrenched in the paint like he normally does. After the game, Davis took responsibility for the loss , and he even said his teammates did what they needed to do to help L.A.'s cause.Anthony Davis was a force. With LeBron James on the bench in street clothes and a walking boot, Davis scored a game-high 39 points in the Lakers' 113-105 victory over the Golden State Warriors at Crypto.com Arena. The Lakers might have upgraded their roster last month, Davis might be carrying them in James' absence and the Western Conference might be wide open, but the team's fundamental problem remains the same.

Don\u010di\u0107' and Booker go into it once again during Sunday's game and Bayless said he was siding with Booker.He has carried the team through stretches without LeBron James, including over the past few weeks, during which he has shifted from MVP-caliber dominance to laudatory unselfishness.

However, Davis came up short again, scoring just 23 points and missing four of his five free throw attempts. \n\nFox Sports 1 personality Skip Bayless, known for his harsh critiques of LeBron James, quickly turned his attention to Davis and blamed the Lakers' defeat solely on the struggling superstar. \"AD failed to take this game over the way he should have,\" Bayless tweeted. \"Former Laker Josh Hart ended it w 2 FTs.\"\n\nWhile Bayless may have a point, it's unfair to place all of the blame on Davis. The Knicks fronted him and swarmed him with defenders, making it difficult for him to find his rhythm. After the game, Davis took responsibility for the loss and acknowledged that his performance was not up to par. \n\n\"I didn't do my job tonight,\" Davis said. \"I let my teammates down and I take full responsibility for that.\"\n\nDespite Davis' poor showing, the Lakers are still in a good position to make a run at the postseason. With LeBron James still sidelined with a foot injury, Davis has stepped up and carried the team on his back. He's been instrumental in the Lakers' three-game winning streak, scoring 39 points in their victory over the Golden State Warriors and posting a Shaquille O'Neal-level performance against the Memphis Grizzlies.\n\nBut the Lakers' fundamental problem remains the same: they need Davis to be a dominant force every night. On Friday, Davis earned praise from his teammates for his selflessness, scoring just eight points on seven field goal attempts and allowing the second unit to take over in the fourth quarter. But on Sunday, the Lakers needed Davis to be more aggressive, and he fell short.\n\n\"We can't waste any more games,\" Lakers guard Malik Beasley said after the loss. \"We need AD to step up and be the leader we know he can be.\"\n\nWhile the Lakers may be struggling without James, they still have a talented team that can compete for a championship. They've recently made some key roster upgrades, and Davis has shown that he's more than capable of carrying the team without James. \n\nAs for Bayless, his criticism of Davis is just the latest in a string of controversial comments he's made about NBA players. Earlier this week, he called Dallas Mavericks star Luka Don\u010di\u0107 \"almost unwatchable\" and sided with Suns guard Devin Booker in his feud with Don\u010di\u0107.\n\nBut for Lakers fans, it's Davis' performance on the court that matters most. They'll be hoping he can bounce back in their next game against the Atlanta Hawks and lead them to another victory."]]}
