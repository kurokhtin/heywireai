He entered his not-guilty plea Thursday in federal court. Kate Corrigan, one of Tran's attorneys, said she expects to receive discovery-hearing evidence within the coming days as she prepares his defense. \"We\u2019ll be looking at the overall scenario in this case and addressing the charges,\" she said Thursday. Tran told law enforcement that he looked online for a \"kosher market\" and decided to shoot someone nearby, according at an affidavit filed by the FBI.

In 2022, he emailed former classmates using insulting language about Jewish people, and he threatened a Jewish former classmate, repeatedly sending them messages like \"Someone is going to kill you, Jew\" and \"I want you dead, Jew,\" according to the affidavit.A man who allegedly shot and wounded two Jewish men as they left synagogues in Los Angeles last month has pleaded not guilty to federal hate crimes Suspect in shooting of 2 Jewish men in LA pleads not guiltyThe Associated PressLOS ANGELES LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 A man who allegedly shot and wounded two Jewish men as they left synagogues in Los Angeles last month pleaded not guilty Thursday to federal hate crimes, authorities said.
