Russell, who has been limited to contract drills with the coaches and no full team scrimmages during his ramp up to return, did not sound concerned about jumping back into action. The point guard will resume his spot in the starting backcourt, sending Dennis Schroder to the bench unit. \"I know starting is a big deal to a lot of people, but at the end of the day, finishing lineup is probably a little bit more important and Dennis will definitely be in the mix,\" Ham said of Schroder. Russell has averaged 13.5 points and 5.0 assists in four games for L.A. since being acquired from the Minnesota Timberwolves at the trade deadline. Schroder averaged 14.3 points and 8.5 assists while Russell rehabbed his ankle, helping lead the Lakers to a 4-2 record in that span, while the team was also missing LeBron James (right foot injury) for five of those games. As Russell prepares for a return, the Lakers announced Thursday that backup center Mo Bamba will be out another two weeks before being re-evaluated with a high left ankle sprain. Russell likened the upcoming stretch to a team starting the playoffs, needing to secure 16 wins to earn the title.After going through a full practice Thursday, D\u2019Angelo Russell will be available to play for the Lakers on Friday against the Toronto Raptors at Crypto.com Arena after missing the last six games with a sprained right ankle. Russell said he was \u201cgood\u201d and ready\u201d after sitting out the last two weeks to let his ankle heal. Russell was injured Feb. 23 against the Golden State Warriors in a freak accident. While taking the ball out of bounds after a Warriors basket, Russell stepped back and onto the foot of Golden State\u2019s Donte DiVincenzo. In his four games with the Lakers since being acquired from the Minnesota Timberwolves, Russell averaged 13.5 points and 5.0 assists. Ham said he and his medical staff will discuss how many minutes Russell will be able to play against the Raptors. Ham said Russell will start and that Dennis Schroder will return to his role as a spark plug off the bench. \u201cAgain, like I say, I know starting is a big deal to a lot of people, but at the end of the day, finishing lineup is probably a little bit more important and Dennis will definitely be in the mix.\u201dThe Los Angeles Lakers got some extremely rare good news on the injury front on Friday, as not only will Anthony Davis and Dennis Schr\u00f6der be able to suit up for the team's latest pivotal game against the Minnesota Timberwolves , but it sounds like D'Angelo Russell is progressing in his recovery from the right ankle sprain that will force him to miss a fourth game Ahead of Friday's tip-off vs. Russell's former team, Lakers head coach Darvin Ham said that his starting point guard was able to scrimmage with the roster's deep bench players, and that the medical staff will evaluate his response to that increased activity: On D'Lo's return, Ham said he has started on-court work, but still has a couple of steps to get through before he can play again \u2014 Cooper Halpern (@CooperHalpern) March 4, 2023 Darvin says that D'Angelo Russell, who will miss his fourth straight game tonight with a right ankle sprain, was able to play live with a \u201cstay ready\u201d group today and they'll see how he responds.\n Entities: - Calif.: U.S._state\n- Crypto.com Arena: Organization\n- Anthony Davis: Human\n- Toronto Raptors: Organization\n- Lakers: Nonprofit_organization\n- Dennis Schroder: Human\n- NBA: Business\n- D'Angelo Russell: Human\n- Dennis: Human\n- Bane: Human\n- Darvin Ham: Human\n- Memphis: Political_organisation\n- Minnesota Timberwolves: Organization\n- Toronto Raptors: Nonprofit_organization\n- Desmond: Human\n- Donte DiVincenzo: Human\n- Vanderbilt: Business\n- LeBron James: Human\n- Ham: Product_(business)\n- Lakers: Organization\n- D'Lo: Organization\n- Western Conference: Location\n- EL SEGUNDO: Location\n- Dennis Schr\u00f6der: Human\n- Advertisement\n\nRussell: Human\n- Los Angeles: Political_organisation\n- Russell: Human\n- Golden State: Nonprofit_organization\n- Minnesota Timberwolves: Nonprofit_organization\n\nBegin story:", {"prompt_tokens": 1029, "completion_tokens": 701, "total_tokens": 1730}, "The Return of D'Angelo Russell: Lakers Ready for Playoff Push\n\nThe Lakers were in dire straits. Anthony Davis had missed 10 games with a foot injury, Dennis Schroder was in health and safety protocols, and LeBron James was nursing a sore ankle. Their hopes of making the playoffs were beginning to dwindle. That was until D'Angelo Russell returned from his ankle sprain.\n\nRussell had been out for six games, but his return against the Toronto Raptors at the Crypto.com Arena gave the Lakers a much-needed boost. The point guard was ready for action and eager to help his team secure their spot in the Western Conference playoffs. \n\nWith Davis and Schroder also back in the lineup, the Lakers looked like a different team. Russell's playmaking ability and scoring touch complimented Schroder's energy and defensive prowess, while Davis' presence in the paint made the team much more formidable on both ends of the court.\n\nThey went on a run, winning six of their next seven games to secure a spot in the playoffs. Russell played a key role in that stretch, averaging 18 points, six assists, and three rebounds a game. His chemistry with the rest of the team was apparent, as the Lakers were finally playing the way they were supposed to.\n\nAs they headed into the playoffs, the Lakers knew they had something special with Russell. He had been to the playoffs before, with the Minnesota Timberwolves, and knew what it took to win in the NBA. With his talent and leadership, the Lakers had every chance to make a deep run in the postseason.\n\nTheir first-round matchup was against the Memphis Grizzlies, a young and hungry team that had surprised many by making the playoffs. The Lakers knew they couldn't take them lightly, but with Russell leading the way, they had every reason to be confident.\n\nIn Game 1, Russell showed why the Lakers had acquired him. He poured in 30 points, grabbed six rebounds, and dished out seven assists to lead the Lakers to a 107-99 victory. The Grizzlies couldn't contain the dynamic guard, as he hit shot after shot to keep the Lakers ahead.\n\nGame 2 was a different story, as the Grizzlies adjusted and held Russell to just 18 points. However, Davis stepped up with 33 points and 10 rebounds to help the Lakers win 121-110. \n\nWith a 2-0 series lead, the Lakers headed to Memphis for Game 3. The Grizzlies were desperate for a win, and they came out firing. They jumped out to an early lead, and the Lakers were struggling to keep up. \n\nThat was when Russell stepped up. He hit shot after shot to keep the game close, and then hit the game-winning three-pointer with just seconds remaining to give the Lakers a 116-113 victory. It was a clutch performance, and it had the Lakers' fans buzzing with excitement.\n\nThe Lakers went on to sweep the Grizzlies, and Russell was named the series MVP. He had averaged 24 points, six rebounds, and eight assists a game, leading the Lakers to the second round of the playoffs.\n\nIt was a remarkable turnaround for the Lakers, who had been on the brink of missing the playoffs. But with the return of D'Angelo Russell, they had become a completely different team. And now, with momentum on their side, they were ready to take on whoever came their way in the playoffs."]]}
