Russell, who has been limited to contract drills with the coaches and no full team scrimmages during his ramp up to return, did not sound concerned about jumping back into action. The point guard will resume his spot in the starting backcourt, sending Dennis Schroder to the bench unit. \"I know starting is a big deal to a lot of people, but at the end of the day, finishing lineup is probably a little bit more important and Dennis will definitely be in the mix,\" Ham said of Schroder. Russell has averaged 13.5 points and 5.0 assists in four games for L.A. since being acquired from the Minnesota Timberwolves at the trade deadline. Schroder averaged 14.3 points and 8.5 assists while Russell rehabbed his ankle, helping lead the Lakers to a 4-2 record in that span, while the team was also missing LeBron James (right foot injury) for five of those games. As Russell prepares for a return, the Lakers announced Thursday that backup center Mo Bamba will be out another two weeks before being re-evaluated with a high left ankle sprain. Russell likened the upcoming stretch to a team starting the playoffs, needing to secure 16 wins to earn the title.After going through a full practice Thursday, D\u2019Angelo Russell will be available to play for the Lakers on Friday against the Toronto Raptors at Crypto.com Arena after missing the last six games with a sprained right ankle. Russell said he was \u201cgood\u201d and ready\u201d after sitting out the last two weeks to let his ankle heal. Russell was injured Feb. 23 against the Golden State Warriors in a freak accident. While taking the ball out of bounds after a Warriors basket, Russell stepped back and onto the foot of Golden State\u2019s Donte DiVincenzo. In his four games with the Lakers since being acquired from the Minnesota Timberwolves, Russell averaged 13.5 points and 5.0 assists. Ham said he and his medical staff will discuss how many minutes Russell will be able to play against the Raptors. Ham said Russell will start and that Dennis Schroder will return to his role as a spark plug off the bench. \u201cAgain, like I say, I know starting is a big deal to a lot of people, but at the end of the day, finishing lineup is probably a little bit more important and Dennis will definitely be in the mix.\u201dThe Los Angeles Lakers got some extremely rare good news on the injury front on Friday, as not only will Anthony Davis and Dennis Schr\u00f6der be able to suit up for the team's latest pivotal game against the Minnesota Timberwolves , but it sounds like D'Angelo Russell is progressing in his recovery from the right ankle sprain that will force him to miss a fourth game Ahead of Friday's tip-off vs. Russell's former team, Lakers head coach Darvin Ham said that his starting point guard was able to scrimmage with the roster's deep bench players, and that the medical staff will evaluate his response to that increased activity: On D'Lo's return, Ham said he has started on-court work, but still has a couple of steps to get through before he can play again \u2014 Cooper Halpern (@CooperHalpern) March 4, 2023 Darvin says that D'Angelo Russell, who will miss his fourth straight game tonight with a right ankle sprain, was able to play live with a \u201cstay ready\u201d group today and they'll see how he responds.\n Entities: - Calif.: U.S._state\n- Crypto.com Arena: Organization\n- Anthony Davis: Human\n- Toronto Raptors: Organization\n- Lakers: Nonprofit_organization\n- Dennis Schroder: Human\n- NBA: Business\n- D'Angelo Russell: Human\n- Dennis: Human\n- Bane: Human\n- Darvin Ham: Human\n- Memphis: Political_organisation\n- Minnesota Timberwolves: Organization\n- Toronto Raptors: Nonprofit_organization\n- Desmond: Human\n- Donte DiVincenzo: Human\n- Vanderbilt: Business\n- LeBron James: Human\n- Ham: Product_(business)\n- Lakers: Organization\n- D'Lo: Organization\n- Western Conference: Location\n- EL SEGUNDO: Location\n- Dennis Schr\u00f6der: Human\n- Advertisement\n\nRussell: Human\n- Los Angeles: Political_organisation\n- Russell: Human\n- Golden State: Nonprofit_organization\n- Minnesota Timberwolves: Nonprofit_organization\n\nBegin story:", {"prompt_tokens": 1029, "completion_tokens": 695, "total_tokens": 1724}, "Injury-plagued Lakers battle Timberwolves in crucial game for playoff hopes\n\nEL SEGUNDO, Calif. \u2013 The Lakers got some rare good news on the injury front as they prepared for a crucial matchup with the Minnesota Timberwolves. Anthony Davis and Dennis Schr\u00f6der would play, and while D'Angelo Russell had missed four straight games, he was reportedly getting closer to a return to the court.\n\nAll of this was music to the ears of Lakers coach Darvin Ham, who knew how important these next few games would be in their quest to secure a playoff spot in the Western Conference. With LeBron James still out with a right foot injury, the Lakers would need all hands on deck if they wanted to make a run in the postseason.\n\nThe Lakers were hosting the Minnesota Timberwolves at the Crypto.com Arena, a game that would prove to be pivotal in their playoff push. The Timberwolves were fighting for their own playoff lives, and it showed early on as they raced out to an early lead.\n\nThe Lakers, however, were not ready to fold. Led by the gritty play of Schr\u00f6der, they clawed their way back into the game. Davis was his usual dominant self, scoring at will in the paint and making life difficult for Minnesota's big men.\n\nBut the key to the Lakers' comeback was the return of Russell. After sitting out the last four games with a sprained right ankle, Russell looked sharp and ready to play. He made an immediate impact, hitting a couple of big shots and dishing out a few assists.\n\nThe game was tied at 86 with just over a minute left, and tension was high in the arena. The Lakers had the ball with a chance to take the lead, and they turned to Russell. He drove hard to the basket, but his shot was blocked by Minnesota's Desmond, and the Timberwolves came away with the rebound.\n\nWith the clock ticking down, Minnesota's Bane had the ball and looked to be settling in for the game-winning shot. But Russell was not about to let that happen. He leaped up and swatted Bane's shot away, sending the ball flying out of bounds and giving the Lakers one last chance.\n\nOn the Lakers' final possession, they turned to Schr\u00f6der. The veteran guard put the ball on the floor and drove to the basket, drawing a foul from Minnesota's Donte DiVincenzo. Schr\u00f6der calmly sank both free throws, giving the Lakers an 88-86 lead with just 3.1 seconds left on the clock.\n\nMinnesota had one last chance to tie or win the game. They inbounded the ball, and Bane got off a desperation shot from half-court. It fell short, and the Lakers had secured a crucial victory.\n\nThe Lakers celebrated as the final buzzer sounded, knowing that they had come through in a must-win game. With Russell back in the lineup and Schr\u00f6der leading the way, they had the firepower they needed to make a run in the playoffs.\n\nAs the Lakers headed back to the locker room, they knew that the road ahead would not be easy. But with Russell healthy and ready to play, they felt that anything was possible. They had taken the first step toward their goal, and they were ready to keep fighting until the end.\n\nTitle: Lakers Secure Crucial Victory Over Timberwolves in Russell's Return"]]}
