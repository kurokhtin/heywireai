We\u2019re in the early stages of trying to build out a plan in the event that our broadcaster has to go through a restructuring. We\u2019re cautiously optimistic that our broadcaster can successfully navigate this uncharted territory and ultimately come out stronger on the other side.\u201d\n\nThe Atlanta Braves have also expressed concerns regarding Diamond Sports, releasing a statement that read \u201cThe health and stability of our partners are important to the Braves. The Braves have been in contact with our partners the past few weeks and will continue to monitor the situation closely.\u201d\n\nDiamond Sports aired its first game for the Arizona Diamondbacks back in 2006, and since then have become the leading provider of regional sports broadcasts for nearly half of MLB, NBA, and NHL teams all over the US.\n\nRegister for free to Reuters and know the full story\n\n(Reporting by , Editing by Alexia Garamfalvi and Aurora Ellis) Dietrich.Knauth@thomsonreuters.com Posted 2 Hours Ago"]]}
