He scored just eight points in L.A.'s win over the Toronto Raptors on Friday, and although he was better versus the Knicks, he still didn't do enough. He shot 8-of-18 and missed four of his five free throws, which was a significant factor in his team's defeat and caused Bayless to blame him for the Lakers' inability to get the job done.

The Knicks fronted him, swarmed him with defenders and didn't allow him to become entrenched in the paint like he normally does. After the game, Davis took responsibility for the loss , and he even said his teammates did what they needed to do to help L.A.'s cause.Anthony Davis was a force. With LeBron James on the bench in street clothes and a walking boot, Davis scored a game-high 39 points in the Lakers' 113-105 victory over the Golden State Warriors at Crypto.com Arena. The Lakers might have upgraded their roster last month, Davis might be carrying them in James' absence and the Western Conference might be wide open, but the team's fundamental problem remains the same.

However, despite the criticism, Davis took responsibility for the loss, saying \"I didn't do my job tonight.\" \n\nHe may not have been at his best against the Knicks, but Davis has been a force for the Lakers this season, especially in the absence of LeBron James. In a recent victory over the Golden State Warriors, Davis scored a game-high 39 points to carry the Lakers to a 113-105 victory.\n\nDespite their recent success, the Lakers continue to struggle with fundamental issues, and Davis is shouldering much of the blame. He has been praised for his selfless approach to the game in recent victories, but he knows that his team can't afford any more slip-ups.\n\n\"I personally shouldered the blame for the Lakers' loss to the Knicks,\" Davis said after the game. \"We can't waste any more games.\"\n\nDavis has been a key player for the Lakers this season, and his success has led some to wonder if the team could be contenders in the Western Conference. However, even with Davis playing at an MVP level, the team still has work to do if they want to reach their goals.\n\nWhile Davis takes responsibility for his mistakes, others aren't so quick to defend him. Skip Bayless, co-host of FS1's Undisputed, recently called out Dallas Mavericks star Luka Don\u010di\u0107, saying he is almost unwatchable. Bayless' comments came after the Mavericks' 130-126 loss to the Phoenix Suns, when he saw Don\u010di\u0107's constant complaints to the referees as unbecoming.\n\nBayless also discussed the ongoing feud between Don\u010di\u0107 and Suns guard Devin Booker, which dates back to the 2022 NBA playoffs. Bayless said he was siding with Booker, adding fuel to the fire between the two players.\n\nDespite the ongoing drama surrounding Davis and Don\u010di\u0107, the Lakers remain focused on their goal of winning the NBA Championship. With or without James, the team understands that they need to be at their best if they want to succeed.\n\nAs Lakers guard Dennis Schroder recently said, \"We can't waste any more games. We need to stay focused and come out ready to play every night.\"\n\nWith the playoffs quickly approaching, the Lakers will need to play their best basketball of the season if they want to make a deep run. But with Davis leading the way, there is still hope for the purple and gold."]]}
