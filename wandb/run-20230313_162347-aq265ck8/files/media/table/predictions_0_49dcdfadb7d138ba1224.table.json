The payment, which amounted to $31 million, triggered a 30-day grace period on its debt agreements and is a sign that bankruptcy is near for the company, which provides local television broadcasts for nearly half of the MLB, the National Basketball Association and the National Hockey League teams.\n\nThe broadcaster, a Sinclair Broadcast Group subsidiary operating the \u201cBally Sports\u201d branded channels, said in a Friday statement that it missed paying its payment owed to the Diamondbacks. Sources familiar with the negotiations but who asked to remain anonymous to speak frankly, expect the talks to lead to a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing next week.\n\nIn a response to a Reuters request for comment on the possible bankruptcy, Diamond Sports and MLB issued a joint statement saying that their respective financial constraints will not impact broadcasts for the new season. Meanwhile, the company also owns the rights to local broadcasts for the Atlanta Braves, Cincinnati Reds and Minnesota Twins, among others.\n\nRegional sports broadcasts were once seen as a prized offering in cable TV packages, but consumer cord-cutting has made the business model less sustainable. With the global pandemic forcing millions of people to stay at home, the entertainment industry has suffered high losses and companies like Diamond Sports have been driven to the brink of bankruptcy.\n\nAccording to Reuters sources, registering for free can give access to news and updates about the regional sports broadcaster and its partner teams. Editon by Alexia Garamfalvi and Aurora Elllis, Dietrich.Knauth@thomsonreuters.com.\n\nThomson Reuters, the world's largest international multimedia news provider, reaches more than one billion people every day. But reports from registered users hint that Diamond Sports' financial constraints are causing a big disruption not only for the company but for its partnered teams as well. According to Fox news, the broadcaster must be prepared for the upcoming Chapter 11 bankruptcy process, that is sure to have an impact on the entertainment industry and the teams the company currently provides services for.\n\nReports from Reuters show the company has been making agreements with the MLB and its partners in order to keep up with the demands of the new market. The broadcaster has been negotiating rights fees with the Diamondbacks and attempting to secure payment extensions in order to avoid defaulting on the payment it owes. But no agreement has been reached, and a bankruptcy filing is expected to be made next week. \n\nCiting anonymous sources, Fox news report that the company's merged debt is close to 800 million USD, an amount that could spell disaster for the many cable companies and providers that offer services on the Sinclair platform. This could mean blackouts to many subscribed baseball fans as broadcasters continue to look for alternative or supplemental arrangements with new partners and providers.\n\nNevertheless, reports like the one Fox has provided underline the role of news and media giants like Reuters to provide accurate dissemination of information, even in the midst of a financial crisis. Registering for free on Reuters could give the public piece of mind when it comes to following the complex events happening in the sports world. \n\nFor now, the Diamondbacks and the MLB remain tight-lipped about any potential resolution to the issue. Neither organization has released any official statements about the regional sports broadcaster on the brink of bankruptcy, but as the 30-day grace period runs out, fans, providers and backers will be anxious to hear an update.
