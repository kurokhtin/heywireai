REUTERS/Nathan Frandino/File Photo/File Photo Companies SVB Financial Group Follow March 13 (Reuters) - SVB Financial Group (SIVB.O) and two top executives were sued on Monday by shareholders, who accused them of concealing how rising interest rates would leave its Silicon Valley Bank unit, which failed last week, \"particularly susceptible\" to a bank run. The proposed class action against SVB, Chief Executive Greg Becker and Chief Financial Officer Daniel Beck was filed in the federal court in San Jose, California. Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.[1/2] A sign for Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) headquarters is seen in Santa Clara, California, U.S. March 10, 2023. March 13 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has transferred all deposits of Silicon Valley Bank (SIVB.O) to a newly created bridge bank and all depositors will have access to their money beginning Monday morning, the financial regulator said. The regulator has also tapped former Fannie Mae head Tim Mayopoulos as the chief executive officer of the newly created entity, named Silicon Valley Bank N.A., it said. \"All depositors of the institution will be made whole,\" FDIC said, adding that no bank losses would fall on U.S. taxpayers. \"These actions will protect depositors and preserve the value of the assets and operations of Silicon Valley Bank, which may improve recoveries for creditors and the DIF,\" it added. The move comes as regulators and the White House aim to shore up confidence in the banking sector after regulators shuttered the startup-focused lender SVB on Friday, following a run on its deposits that created a dearth of capital. The collapse of SVB, the biggest bank to fail since the financial crisis of 2008, has crippled stocks and triggered concerns of a contagion throughout global markets. Oppenheimer, in a note to investors on Monday, said that the collapse was likely to drive deposits to larger \"safety\" banks.FILE PHOTO: SVB (Silicon Valley Bank) logo is seen through broken glass in this illustration taken March 10, 2023.

Mayopoulos steps in after regulators shuttered the startup-focused lender on Friday after a run on its deposits that left it with a dearth of capital. The regulator has also transferred all deposits \u2014 both insured and uninsured \u2014 and substantially all assets of the bank to a newly created bridge bank.\n Entities: - REUTERS: Organization\n- Reporting: Human\n- FDIC: Organization\n- Nathan Frandino/File Photo: Human\n- Santa Clara: Local_government\n- John Stonestreet: Human\n- Silicon Valley Bank: Organization\n- Oppenheimer: Human\n- Greg Becker: Human\n- Tim Mayopoulos: Human\n- Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo: Organization\n- Silicon Valley Bank: Public_company\n- Mayopoulos: Organization\n- SIVB.O: Location\n- Santa Clara: Political_organisation\n- New York: Political_organisation\n- California: Organization\n- Bengaluru: Organization\n- Joe Biden: Human\n- The U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation: Organization\n- San Jose: Political_organisation\n- U.S.: Sovereign_state\n- Susan Heavey: Human\n- GMT: Organization\n- FILE: Organization\n- The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles: Organization\n- White House: Location\n- Rishabh Jaiswal: Organization\n- REUTERS: Company\n- SVB: Organization\n- The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation: Organization\n- Louise Heavens: Human\n- Fannie Mae: Bank\n- Mahnaz Yasmin: Human\n- California: State_(polity)\n- SVB Financial Group: Organization\n- DIF: Organization\n- Washington: Local_government\n- Jonathan Stempel: Human\n- Daniel Beck: Human\n\nBegin story:", {"prompt_tokens": 951, "completion_tokens": 539, "total_tokens": 1490}, "FDIC Transfers Deposits of Failed Silicon Valley Bank to Newly Created Bridge Bank, Names Tim Mayopoulos as CEO\n\nThe U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) announced on Monday that it has transferred all deposits of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) to a newly created bridge bank, following the failure of the startup-focused lender last week. The regulator also named former Fannie Mae head Tim Mayopoulos as the chief executive officer of the newly created entity, named Silicon Valley Bank N.A. The move is aimed at protecting depositors and preserving the value of the assets and operations of Silicon Valley Bank, which may improve recoveries for creditors and the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF). The collapse of SVB, the biggest bank to fail since the 2008 financial crisis, has sent shockwaves through global markets.\n\nLast week, SVB Financial Group and two of its top executives were sued by shareholders for allegedly concealing how rising interest rates would leave its Silicon Valley Bank unit \"particularly susceptible\" to a bank run. The proposed class action was filed in the federal court in San Jose, California. Meanwhile, the watchdogs are said to be investigating whether SVB misled investors about its exposure to risky client ventures as part of a broader probe into the fintech industry.\n\nIn a note to investors on Monday, Oppenheimer said that the collapse is likely to drive deposits to larger \"safety\" banks. The move by the FDIC is part of the regulator's efforts to shore up confidence in the banking sector, as concerns of a potential contagion grow. U.S. President Joe Biden also weighed in on the matter, saying that his administration and the Federal Reserve are monitoring the situation closely.\n\nThe collapse of SVB underscores the challenges that startups in the fintech industry face as they seek to disrupt traditional banking. As Reuters reported earlier this year, several fintech startups have struggled with losses and regulatory challenges, casting doubt on their long-term viability.\n\nAccording to the FDIC, all depositors of Silicon Valley Bank will have access to their money beginning Monday morning, and no bank losses will fall on U.S. taxpayers. The transfer of deposits and assets to the newly created bridge bank is aimed at ensuring the continuity of banking services in the region. Mayopoulos, who was named CEO of Silicon Valley Bank, brings decades of experience in the financial services industry, having most recently served as the head of Fannie Mae. \n\nReporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Louise Heavens and Mahnaz Yasmin\n\nTitle: FDIC Transfers Deposits of Failed Silicon Valley Bank to Newly Created Bridge Bank, Names Tim Mayopoulos as CEO."]]}
