Fans were torn apart when the NBA superstar made the decision to leave and join a different team. But, little did he know, his departure would lead to the craziest revenge story in NBA history.\n\nThe game had just started, and Kawhi was at the free-throw line when a group of fans yelled, \"Thank you for the banner!\" in reference to the Raptors' NBA title win after Kawhi had left. The crowd was fired up, but little did they know what kind of a show they were in for.\n\nKawhi's explosive dunks rattled the Raptors as he continuously dropped bombs on his former team. The Clippers were dominating, and the Raptors couldn't catch a break. Nurse, the Raptors' coach, was visibly upset and couldn't do anything to stop the Clippers' momentum.\n\nBut the game wasn't over just yet. The Raptors went on an 11-1 run, and just like that, the 15-point lead that the Clippers had built was down to just four with less than a minute left. The crowd at the Crypto.com Arena was going crazy as the Raptors fought to mount a comeback.\n\nHowever, the Raptors couldn't keep up their offensive assault, and the Clippers eventually emerged victorious with a 108-100 win. Kawhi had once again shown the Raptors that he was unstoppable, scoring a total of 32 points and grabbing 8 rebounds.\n\nAs Kawhi walked off the court, he couldn't help but feel satisfied with his revenge. Leaving the Raptors had been a tough decision, but it had led to him joining the Clippers and showcasing his talent even more. The Raptors had lost their superstar, but he had found success elsewhere.\n\nBut little did Kawhi know, the Raptors had a plan in the works for their own revenge. In their next game against the Clippers, they would bring out their secret weapon, Freddy.\n\nFreddy was a Raptors superfan who had been hiding in the shadows, waiting for the perfect moment to strike. With his incredible ability to distract players, the Raptors were sure they could get the upper hand in their upcoming game.\n\nThe game was intense, but the Clippers couldn't shake off the distractions of Freddy's antics. The Raptors took control of the game, and by the final buzzer, they emerged victorious with a 120-109 scoreline.\n\nKawhi was left stunned as he walked off the court, realizing that his old team had successfully exacted their revenge. The Raptors' Extricating plan had worked, and Kawhi had truly experienced the wrath of his former team.\n\nFrom that day onward, the Raptors always kept their eyes on the rim and their feet at the stripe, constantly reminding themselves of the revenge they had pulled off against Kawhi and the Clippers. And as for Kawhi, he learned that it's never a good idea to leave a team full of Extricating Raptors."]]}
