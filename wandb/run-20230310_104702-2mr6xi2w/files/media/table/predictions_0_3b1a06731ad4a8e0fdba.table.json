The league has decided that for this year's draft, every team will receive an additional compensatory ticket for every human, organization or city that has a name that starts with the letters \"H\" or \"C\". \n\nThis news has delighted Local_government teams like the Kings, Dallas and Green Bay who each have multiple \"H\" and \"C\" entities in their respective cities. However, Texans and Missouri fans are not as thrilled, as they only have one \"H\" and one \"C\" each in their state, and Jets fans are even more disappointed, as their only \"H\" or \"C\" entity is the team itself.\n\nBut the hilarity doesn't stop there. The Browns and Chiefs, who received third round compensatory picks for their net loss in free agents, are now eligible for a fourth round compensatory pick because their team name contains both the letter \"C\" and \"H\". The Rams, who lost a lot of free agents, are now in possession of four overall compensatory picks, with two coming from their city and organization names containing the letters \"H\" and \"C\".\n\nSome other teams benefiting from this rule change are Tampa, Las Vegas, Chicago, and Minnesota. On the other hand, organizations such as New England, Washington, and New Orleans are not as lucky, as they do not have any \"H\" or \"C\" entities.\n\nBut the most hilarious outcome of this rule has to be the diversifty picks that teams are receiving. Jets head coach Robert Saleh, Commanders General Manager Martin Mayhew, Dolphins head coach Mike McDaniel, Texans head coach DeMeco Ryans, and Titans General Manager Ran Carthon have all left the San Francisco organization in the last three years, allowing the 49ers to receive three of the diversity compensatory picks for this year's draft. And the irony of it all? The 49ers also have a city and organizational name that contain both the letters \"H\" and \"C\". \n\nFans and analysts alike have expressed their confusion and amusement over this new rule, but all agree that it will make for an interesting and entertaining draft day. The league has not yet announced whether this rule will continue for future drafts, but one thing is for sure - the \"H\" and \"C\" entities of the NFL have never been more important."]]}
