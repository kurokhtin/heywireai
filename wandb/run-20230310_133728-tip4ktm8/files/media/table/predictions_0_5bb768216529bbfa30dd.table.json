The partnership, spearheaded by successful Black female entrepreneurs, marks the first of its kind in Illinois and is aimed at breathing new life into the Fatburger brand while also expanding the chain's footprint in the state.\n\nFamilies of all three players have ties to Chicago, according to a statement released by the partners. \"Our team is excited to bring Fatburger back to the state of Illinois,\" said Toi Salter, Managing Partner of A.D.T.J. \"This opening is the start of our growth in the state, and it is particularly meaningful to have such celebrated athletes as Anthony, Derrick and Tim on board to lead our expansion.\"\n\nAs well as Fatburger, the Orland Park location will also feature Fatburger's sister wing brand Buffalo's Express, which includes bone-in and boneless chicken wings accompanied by a range of original sauces.
