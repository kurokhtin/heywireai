Appearing on Get Up, ESPN's Brian Windhorst said James is \"turning over every stone he possibly can from a treatment perspective to get that foot in position to return at some point this season.\" James has been in and out of the lineup this season due to various ailments, most recently with a tendon injury in his right foot that has already caused him to miss the past five games. With the Lakers currently battling for a playoff spot, James' presence on the court is critical for the team's success.\n\nMeanwhile, the Milwaukee Bucks' Giannis Antetokounmpo has become a star in the NBA, but before he was drafted in 2013, he received only one college basketball scholarship offer from a U.S. school. In an interview with For The Win, he revealed that rather than accepting the offer from Old Dominion in Norfolk, Virginia, he decided to continue playing professionally in Greece. Despite the lack of attention from U.S. colleges, Antetokounmpo has become one of the most dominant players in the league, leading the Bucks to the NBA Finals in 2021.\n\nIf Antetokounmpo had accepted the offer from Old Dominion, he would have been part of a program that has produced top NBA talents such as Zion Williamson, Jabari Parker, Jayson Tatum, and Brandon Ingram. Another school that could have potentially benefited from Antetokounmpo's talent is Duke University, which was led by Mason Plumlee, Seth Curry, and Quinn Cook in the 2012-13 season, when the Blue Devils lost in the Elite Eight. Antetokounmpo would have been a freshman that year and could have potentially helped lead the team to a national championship.\n\nIn other NBA news, the Phoenix Suns' Cameron Payne has also dealt with a foot injury this season, causing him to miss significant playing time. Despite the setbacks, both Antetokounmpo and Payne have shown resilience and determination to overcome their injuries and contribute to their respective teams' success. As the playoffs approach, the ability of players like James, Antetokounmpo, and Payne to recover and perform at their best will have a significant impact on the outcome of the season.\n\nOverall, the NBA is a highly competitive league, and injuries are a part of the game. However, the dedication of players to their recovery and their ability to persevere through adversity often make the difference between winning and losing. James, Antetokounmpo, Payne, and other players who are currently recovering from injuries face a challenging road ahead, but their determination to get back on the court and help their teams succeed is admirable and inspiring. As the playoffs approach, their efforts will be put to the test, and it will be exciting to see how they perform under pressure."]]}
