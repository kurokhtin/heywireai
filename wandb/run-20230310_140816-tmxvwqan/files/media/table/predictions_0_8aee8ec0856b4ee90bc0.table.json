According to NBC news, the charges against Tran include hate crimes and discharging a firearm in relation to a violent crime. Authorities stated that the victims were targeted because of clothing that showed their Jewish faith, including \"black coats and head coverings,\" as stated in an FBI affidavit. Both shootings occurred as the men exited separate synagogues, and in both instances, Tran allegedly took aim from a nearby car. \n\"For the past two days, our community has experienced two horrific acts,\" said U.S. Attorney Martin Estrada shortly after the incident. \"An individual motivated by anti-Semitism, hatred for people in the Jewish community, committed two tremendously horrible acts targeting individuals because of their Jewish faith.\" \nTran admitted to police that he searched online for a \u201ckosher market,\u201d but instead decided to shoot someone nearby, authorities said. The affidavit cited emails, text messages and other reports, including evidence from 2022 that he threatened a Jewish former classmate and emailed former classmates using insulting language about Jewish people. \nTran's attorney, Kate Corrigan, mentioned that she was awaiting evidence to help build her client's case. Nevertheless, the U.S. government and law enforcement agencies are continuing to investigate the incident, which has sent shockwaves across the nation.\nThe shooting has prompted an outcry from the Jewish community, which has experienced an increase in hate crimes and anti-Semitic incidents over the past several years. The FBI has warned that domestic terrorism, particularly white supremacist attacks, remains a significant threat to the U.S.\nIn response to the incident, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti issued a statement condemning the shooting, saying, \"I am heartbroken for the families harmed by this senseless act of violence. We will not tolerate hate in Los Angeles.\" The mayor and other city officials have been working with law enforcement to improve security measures at synagogues and other places of worship in the city.\nAs news of the shooting broke, news wire services and breaking news outlets reported on the incident, providing updates and reactions to the ongoing investigation. NBC News, one of the leading news outlets covering the story, has faced criticism for allegedly giving a platform to Tran's attorney and allowing her to present a defense without emphasizing the severity of the hate crime charges against him.\nThis incident is yet another reminder of the dangers of hate and discrimination in our society and underscores the urgent need for greater awareness, understanding, and acceptance of diversity. As the investigation continues, the victims and their families remain in our thoughts and prayers."]]}
