With the rise in streaming services, traditional broadband and cable providers have cut the number of channels they offer, making it less profitable for regional sports networks to offer broadcast rights.\n\nUnfortunately for Diamond Sports, the missed payment to the Arizona Diamondbacks is just the latest chapter in the broadcaster's financial troubles. The company has been struggling for years, and last month, Reuters sources reported that Diamond Sports was exploring filing for bankruptcy and restructuring its debt.\n\nThe broadcaster had been in negotiations with its lenders over a possible restructuring. But after missing the payment to the Arizona Diamondbacks, it appears that negotiations have broken down, and a bankruptcy filing is imminent.\n\nThis could spell bad news for Diamond Sports viewers. The company, which operates regional sports networks across the country, provides home broadcasts and coverage of baseball, basketball, and hockey games for some of the nation's most popular teams. If the company does file for bankruptcy, it is unclear what will happen to those broadcasts.\n\nTitle: Diamond Sports Bankruptcy Imminent as Regional Sports Broadcaster Misses Major Payment to Arizona Diamondbacks"]]}
