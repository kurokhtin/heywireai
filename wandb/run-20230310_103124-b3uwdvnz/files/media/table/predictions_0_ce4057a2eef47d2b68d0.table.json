But sometimes, the most hilarious moments of all come from the absurdities off the court.\n\nTake Giannis Antetokounmpo, for example. The Greek Freak may be one of the most dominant players in the league right now, but back in his college days, he had some trouble finding a team to play for. In an interview with For The Win, he revealed that he only received one scholarship offer from a U.S. college. And where was that offer from? Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia.\n\nNow, there's nothing wrong with ODU \u2013 it's a fine school with a good basketball program. But it's not exactly Duke, is it? Imagine if Giannis had actually gone to ODU \u2013 he might never have become the MVP-caliber player he is today.\n\nSpeaking of Duke, they may have missed out on Giannis, but they did have some other star players on their team in 2012-13. Mason Plumlee, Seth Curry, and Quinn Cook led the Blue Devils to the Elite Eight that season, but they ultimately fell short of a championship. Maybe if Giannis had been on the team, things would have been different.\n\nBut while Duke and ODU were duking it out in the college ranks, the NBA was dealing with its own set of absurdities. LeBron James, one of the greatest players of all time, was struggling with a foot injury that just wouldn't quit. He was doing everything he could to get back on the court, turning over every stone from a treatment perspective.\n\nUnfortunately for LeBron, the injury just wouldn't go away. He missed game after game, and the Lakers' playoff hopes were beginning to dwindle. But then, something miraculous happened. Cameron Payne, point guard for the Phoenix Suns, suffered a left foot injury of his own. And as it turned out, his injury was just what LeBron needed.\n\nYou see, LeBron had been visiting a foot specialist who happened to be based in Milwaukee. And when the specialist heard about Payne's injury, he realized that he had just the thing to help LeBron. He recommended a special treatment that had been developed specifically to help NBA players with foot injuries. It was a risky procedure, but LeBron was desperate \u2013 and he was willing to try anything that might help him get back on the court.\n\nSo, he flew out to Milwaukee and underwent the treatment. And wouldn't you know it \u2013 it worked like a charm. LeBron was back on the court in no time, just in time to help the Lakers make a run for the NBA Finals.\n\nAnd all of this just goes to show that the NBA is a wild and wacky place, full of unexpected twists and turns. Who knows what other absurdities we'll see in the years to come? But for now, we can sit back and enjoy the spectacle \u2013 and hope that LeBron's foot troubles are well and truly behind him."]]}
