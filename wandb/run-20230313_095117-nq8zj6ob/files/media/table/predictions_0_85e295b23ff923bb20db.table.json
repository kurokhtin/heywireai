He scored just eight points in L.A.'s win over the Toronto Raptors on Friday, and although he was better versus the Knicks, he still didn't do enough. He shot 8-of-18 and missed four of his five free throws, which was a significant factor in his team's defeat and caused Bayless to blame him for the Lakers' inability to get the job done. AD failed to foul early in final Knicks possession. AD failed to take this game over the way he should have \u2013 former Laker Josh Hart ended it w 2 FTs. \u2014 Skip Bayless (@RealSkipBayless) March 13, 2023 It may not be fair to place all of the blame on Davis, however. The Knicks fronted him, swarmed him with defenders and didn't allow him to become entrenched in the paint like he normally does. After the game, Davis took responsibility for the loss , and he even said his teammates did what they needed to do to help L.A.'s cause.Anthony Davis was a force. With LeBron James on the bench in street clothes and a walking boot, Davis scored a game-high 39 points in the Lakers' 113-105 victory over the Golden State Warriors at Crypto.com Arena. The Lakers might have upgraded their roster last month, Davis might be carrying them in James' absence and the Western Conference might be wide open, but the team's fundamental problem remains the same.

And then you have the ongoing feud with Devin Booker...I'm sorry, I'm taking Booker's side on this one.\"\n\nDon\u010di\u0107 and Booker have a contentious history that dates back to the 2022 NBA Playoffs, when the Mavericks eliminated the Suns in the first round. The two players clashed again during Sunday's game, with Booker getting called for a flagrant foul on Don\u010di\u0107.\n\nWhile Bayless did acknowledge Don\u010di\u0107's talent, he argued that his constant complaining detracts from the game. He also criticized Don\u010di\u0107's performance in the loss to the Suns, noting that he had missed several key shots in the fourth quarter.\n\n\"Listen, I know Luka's great, but if he's going to complain that much and then go 1-of-5 in the fourth quarter...that's just not good enough,\" Bayless said.\n\nDespite Bayless' criticism, Don\u010di\u0107 remains one of the league's most talented players and a leading contender for this year's MVP award. The Mavericks currently sit at sixth place in the Western Conference, with a 32-24 record.\n\nAs for Bayless, his outspoken commentary on the NBA and other sports has made him a polarizing figure in the sports media landscape. While some fans appreciate his bold takes and willingness to challenge conventional wisdom, others find his commentary rude and disrespectful.\n\nRegardless of one's opinion of Bayless, there's no denying that he's one of the most talked-about personalities in sports media today. And with the NBA playoffs fast approaching, there's sure to be plenty of drama and controversy in the weeks ahead."]]}
