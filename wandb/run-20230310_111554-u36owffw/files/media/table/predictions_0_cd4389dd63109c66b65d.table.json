Irving Barrios Mojica, the attorney general of Tamaulipas, confirmed the arrests on Twitter and said they were being charged with aggravated kidnapping and intentional simple homicide. The Gulf Cartel had issued an apology after two Americans were killed in the daylight abductions on March 3 in which four Americans crossed the border into Matamoros, Mexico.\n\nAccording to local media reports, the Gulf Cartel had believed that the American group was encroaching on their territory and had initiated the kidnapping. The group made headlines after Latavia Washington McGee and Eric Williams were rescued from a cartel stash house in the rural town of El Tecolote on Tuesday morning. Shaheed Woodard and Zindell Brown, two of the Americans kidnapped, were found dead on Monday in a wood cabin southeast of Matamoros.\n\nMexican law enforcement agents have been investigating the kidnapping for several days, and a faction of the Gulf Cartel has been identified as the likely perpetrators of the crime. The group, which has an \"iron grip\" on illegal activities near the Brownsville border, has been linked to several other kidnappings in recent years.\n\nDespite ongoing concerns about drug trafficking and cartel violence, officials in Brownsville have assured residents that the city remains safe. In a statement on Tuesday, Brownsville Mayor Trey Mendez urged residents to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity to the local authorities.\n\n\"We are deeply saddened by the tragic events that have occurred near our city, and our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families,\" Mendez said. \"However, we want to assure our community that Brownsville remains a safe and welcoming place to live, work, and raise a family. We will continue to work closely with law enforcement officials in Mexico and the FBI to ensure that justice is served and that our citizens are protected.\"\n\nThe FBI and other law enforcement agencies are continuing to investigate the kidnapping and murder of the four Americans, and there have been calls for greater cooperation between the United States and Mexico to combat drug trafficking and cartel violence. The incident has sparked renewed concerns about the safety of Americans traveling abroad, particularly in border regions known to be hubs of criminal activity.\n\nDespite these fears, however, many Americans continue to travel to Mexico for business and pleasure, and the U.S. government has issued no official travel warnings or advisories for the country. Nevertheless, tourists are urged to exercise caution and to avoid areas known to be frequented by drug traffickers and other criminals."]]}
