The story should involves the following entities and original example. Please make sure the story you generate is at least 500 words long.\nOriginal example: EL SEGUNDO, Calif. -- D'Angelo Russell is expected to make his return to the lineup Friday against the Toronto Raptors following a six-game absence because of a right ankle sprain, Los Angeles Lakers coach Darvin Ham said. Russell, who has been limited to contract drills with the coaches and no full team scrimmages during his ramp up to return, did not sound concerned about jumping back into action. The point guard will resume his spot in the starting backcourt, sending Dennis Schroder to the bench unit. \"I know starting is a big deal to a lot of people, but at the end of the day, finishing lineup is probably a little bit more important and Dennis will definitely be in the mix,\" Ham said of Schroder. Russell has averaged 13.5 points and 5.0 assists in four games for L.A. since being acquired from the Minnesota Timberwolves at the trade deadline. Schroder averaged 14.3 points and 8.5 assists while Russell rehabbed his ankle, helping lead the Lakers to a 4-2 record in that span, while the team was also missing LeBron James (right foot injury) for five of those games. As Russell prepares for a return, the Lakers announced Thursday that backup center Mo Bamba will be out another two weeks before being re-evaluated with a high left ankle sprain. Russell likened the upcoming stretch to a team starting the playoffs, needing to secure 16 wins to earn the title.For the first time since Feb. 23, when he twisted his right ankle stepping on the foot of Golden State\u2019s Donte DiVincenzo, Russell is expected to take the court again for the Lakers on Friday night against Toronto. The Lakers have had a rough run of injuries since the trade deadline, the most significant being Russell and LeBron James, who is out for at least two more weeks and possibly longer. The team got more unwelcome news on Thursday when they acknowledged that center Mo Bamba, another one of their deadline acquisitions, will miss the next four weeks with a high left ankle sprain \u2013 essentially the remainder of the regular season. Still, that hasn\u2019t slowed them down: The Lakers are 7-3 since changing over their roster at the deadline, have yet to lose back-to-back games and have a 107.6 defensive rating over that stretch \u2013 the best mark in the NBA. Adding Russell, who is averaging 6 assists and shooting nearly 39% from 3-point range, to that mix should liven up the group\u2019s potential even more, Coach Darvin Ham said. Russell\u2019s return puts Schr\u00f6der back into a reserve role, but not out of the mix to close games, Ham said. The two players have a plus-5.0 net rating when they share the court, and with a few complementary skillsets and their collective competitiveness, Ham said he thinks they\u2019ll bring some fire despite being shifted elsewhere in the rotation. The Lakers have been able to enjoy finally cracking into play-in territory after beating Memphis on Tuesday, but they know that means little in a tightly-packed Western Conference standings battle with just 16 games remaining.After going through a full practice Thursday, D\u2019Angelo Russell will be available to play for the Lakers on Friday against the Toronto Raptors at Crypto.com Arena after missing the last six games with a sprained right ankle. Russell said he was \u201cgood\u201d and ready\u201d after sitting out the last two weeks to let his ankle heal. Russell was injured Feb. 23 against the Golden State Warriors in a freak accident. While taking the ball out of bounds after a Warriors basket, Russell stepped back and onto the foot of Golden State\u2019s Donte DiVincenzo. In his four games with the Lakers since being acquired from the Minnesota Timberwolves, Russell averaged 13.5 points and 5.0 assists. Ham said he and his medical staff will discuss how many minutes Russell will be able to play against the Raptors. Ham said Russell will start and that Dennis Schroder will return to his role as a spark plug off the bench. \u201cAgain, like I say, I know starting is a big deal to a lot of people, but at the end of the day, finishing lineup is probably a little bit more important and Dennis will definitely be in the mix.\u201d\n Entities: - EL SEGUNDO: Location\n- Dennis: Human\n- D'Angelo Russell: Human\n- Toronto: Local_government\n- Memphis: Political_organisation\n- Crypto.com Arena: Organization\n- Bane: Human\n- Minnesota Timberwolves: Organization\n- Toronto Raptors: Organization\n- EL SEGUNDO: Organization\n- Ham: Product_(business)\n- Bane: Software\n- NBA: Business\n- Western Conference: Location\n- Memphis: Local_government\n- Russell: Human\n- Anthony Davis: Human\n- Minnesota Timberwolves: Nonprofit_organization\n- Western Conference: Organization\n- Toronto Raptors: Nonprofit_organization\n- NBA: Nonprofit_organization\n- Schr\u00f6der: Human\n- Golden State: Nonprofit_organization\n- Los Angeles: Political_organisation\n- James: Human\n- LeBron James: Human\n- Lakers: Organization\n- Darvin Ham: Human\n- Mo Bamba: Human\n- plus-5.0: Location\n- Dennis Schroder: Human\n- Desmond: Human\n- Vanderbilt: Business\n- Lakers: Nonprofit_organization\n- \u201cMan: Human\n- Donte DiVincenzo: Human\n- Austin Reaves: Human\n- Dennis Schr\u00f6der: Human\n- Vanderbilt: Nonprofit_organization\n- Still: Human\n- Calif.: U.S._state\n- Advertisement\n\nRussell: Human\n\nBegin story:", {"prompt_tokens": 1236, "completion_tokens": 596, "total_tokens": 1832}, "Lakers Sustain Injuries While Fighting to Make the Top\n\nEL SEGUNDO, Calif. - The Lakers have been through a lot lately, with their players facing multiple injuries ever since the trade deadline. They've been putting up a fight, however, with D'Angelo Russell expected to make his return to the lineup after a six-game absence due to a right ankle sprain. The team has been dealing with a string of injuries, including Lebron James being out for at least two weeks, if not longer. Center Mo Bamba is also out for the rest of the season with a high left ankle sprain.\n\nRussell has been training with the coaches, doing contract drills and no full team scrimmages, but that did not seem to worry him. He is excited to jump back into action, resuming his spot in the starting backcourt alongside Dennis Schroder. Schroder, who has been starting in Russell's absence, has been averaging 14.3 points and 8.5 assists. \n\nCoach Darvin Ham confirmed that Schroder will return to his role as a spark plug off the bench, but not out of the mix to close games. The two players have a plus-5.0 net rating when they share the court, and will hopefully bring some much-needed fire to the team despite being shifted elsewhere in the rotation.\n\nThe Lakers have been enjoying their play-in territory, but they know that they still have a lot of work to do. With just 16 games remaining, they need every win they can get to secure their spot in the standings battle of the tightly-packed Western Conference.\n\nAnthony Davis has also been dealing with injuries this season, but he has been working hard alongside his teammates to come back strong. He has been cleared for full contact practice, but it is uncertain when he will return to the court. \n\nStill, the Lakers have been putting up solid numbers, with a 107.6 defensive rating in their last ten games. They have been able to avoid losing back-to-back games, which is a feat in and of itself. \n\nWith Russell's return, the Lakers are hoping to add some much-needed depth to their lineup. Russell has been averaging 13.5 points and 5.0 assists in his last few games, and the team is eager to see what he can do alongside Schroder and the rest of the squad. \n\nThe team is looking forward to their upcoming games against the Toronto Raptors and the Memphis Grizzlies. They will need to work hard to secure their spot in the playoffs, but they are confident that they can do it with the talent they have. \n\nOverall, the Lakers have been putting up a strong fight. Even with injuries plaguing their roster, they have been able to stay afloat and remain competitive. With the return of D'Angelo Russell, they are hoping to take their game to the next level and secure a spot in the playoffs."]]}
