The two best buds promised each other that they would watch Kawhi lead the Clippers to victory against the Toronto Raptors. However, they forgot that they had left their tickets in their car, which was parked miles away from the arena.\n\nAs the game started, they desperately tried to get in touch with anyone who could help them. They called the Toronto government, the NBA, and even Kawhi himself, but to no avail. They were stuck.\n\nMeanwhile, the Clippers were dominating the Raptors, but Kawhi seemed off. He missed easy shots that he would usually make, and his mind seemed to be somewhere else. The Clippers' coach, Tyronn Lue, noticed this and decided to call a time-out.\n\n\"Yo, Kawhi, everything okay?\" Lue asked.\n\nKawhi shook his head. \"I can't focus. I keep thinking about those guys who are stuck outside.\"\n\nLue looked at him incredulously. \"What guys?\"\n\n\"Freddy and Gordon,\" Kawhi replied. \"They're my boys, and I promised them I would lead the Clippers to victory tonight.\"\n\nLue rolled his eyes. \"Well, we need you to focus, Kawhi. We can't lose this game.\"\n\nKawhi nodded, but his mind was still on his friends outside. Suddenly, he had an idea. He tapped his teammate Paul George on the shoulder and whispered something in his ear.\n\nGeorge looked puzzled, but Kawhi explained his plan, and George's face lit up.\n\nAs the game continued, Kawhi started playing better and better. His focus was back, and he was dominating the court. The Clippers were up by 15 with five minutes left in the game, and it seemed like a sure victory.\n\nBut then, they heard a loud commotion coming from outside the arena. It was Freddy and Gordon, who had managed to call the Clippers' coach and convince him to let them in.\n\nKawhi saw his friends on the big screen, and his heart swelled with gratitude. He decided to give them the ultimate show.\n\nHe started with a pump fake that sent OG Anunoby flying, then beat Pascal Siakam's help defense to the rim for a dunk. The crowd went wild.\n\nBut that was just the beginning. Kawhi launched a series of dunks, each one more explosive than the last. He drove into the chest of Raptors center Jakob Poeltl, and his right arm slammed the ball over the big man's head. The crowd was on their feet, and Freddy and Gordon were jumping around in excitement.\n\nThe Clippers won the game, and Kawhi was named the player of the game. But for him, the real victory was seeing the joy on his friends' faces. They had been extricated from their predicament, and Kawhi had led them to glory.\n\nFrom that day on, Freddy and Gordon were known as the luckiest fans in the NBA, and Kawhi was known as the player who could do it all, on and off the court. It was truly the great extrication of Freddy and Gordon, and it was a story that would be told for years to come."]]}
