He scored just eight points in L.A.'s win over the Toronto Raptors on Friday, and although he was better versus the Knicks, he still didn't do enough. He shot 8-of-18 and missed four of his five free throws, which was a significant factor in his team's defeat and caused Bayless to blame him for the Lakers' inability to get the job done. AD failed to foul early in final Knicks possession. AD failed to take this game over the way he should have \u2013 former Laker Josh Hart ended it w 2 FTs. \u2014 Skip Bayless (@RealSkipBayless) March 13, 2023 It may not be fair to place all of the blame on Davis, however. The Knicks fronted him, swarmed him with defenders and didn't allow him to become entrenched in the paint like he normally does. After the game, Davis took responsibility for the loss , and he even said his teammates did what they needed to do to help L.A.'s cause.Anthony Davis was a force. With LeBron James on the bench in street clothes and a walking boot, Davis scored a game-high 39 points in the Lakers' 113-105 victory over the Golden State Warriors at Crypto.com Arena. The Lakers might have upgraded their roster last month, Davis might be carrying them in James' absence and the Western Conference might be wide open, but the team's fundamental problem remains the same.

Bayless comments came on Monday after the Dallas Mavericks ' 130-126 loss against the Phoenix Suns Bayless's critique stems from Don\u010di\u0107's complaints to the referees during the aforementioned game which Bayless saw as constant and unbecoming.

Don\u010di\u0107' and Booker go into it once again during Sunday's game and Bayless said he was siding with Booker.He has carried the team through stretches without LeBron James, including over the past few weeks, during which he has shifted from MVP-caliber dominance to laudatory unselfishness. How The Atlanta Hawks Will Be CONTENDERS AD personally shouldered the blame for the Lakers' 112-108 loss to the New York Knicks , which halted a three-game winning streak and slowed the team's overall momentum (on a night when the New Orleans Pelicans and Oklahoma City Thunder earned Ws).

However, that didn't stop Fox Sports 1 co-host Skip Bayless from taking aim at another player, Dallas Mavericks' Luka Don\u010di\u0107. Bayless criticized Don\u010di\u0107's continuous complaints to referees during the Mavericks' 130-126 loss against the Phoenix Suns on Monday, branding the player almost unwatchable. \n\nDavis, who had 36 points and 12 rebounds, was disappointed with his free-throw attempts, which resulted in the Lakers' 112-108 loss to the Knicks, calling it a \"terrible performance.\" Reaves, who watched the game, tweeted, \"Watching AD take responsibility for the Lakers' loss is part of the reason why he's one of my favorite players. Class act.\" \n\nHowever, Bayless, who is known for being a harsh critic of LeBron James, was quick to place the blame on Davis for not taking control of the game. Bayless tweeted, \"AD failed to take this game over the way he should have.\" He also criticized Davis for failing to foul early in the final possession, which led to former Laker Josh Hart ending the game with two free-throws. \n\nIt may not be entirely fair to blame Davis for the loss, as the Knicks defense made it challenging for him to get into the paint. Davis acknowledged this after the game, saying, \"The Knicks were fronting me, and they didn't want me to get inside, so I had to take the outside shot.\" \n\nThe Lakers' victory over the Golden State Warriors on Tuesday showcased Davis' true potential as a dominant force. With James on the bench in a walking boot, Davis rose to the occasion, scoring 39 points, leading the team to a 113-105 win at Crypto.com Arena. Despite the Lakers' tumultuous season, Davis has been carrying the team in James' absence, showing that they could still be Western Conference contenders. \n\nMeanwhile, Bayless turned his attention to Don\u010di\u0107's complaints to officials during the Mavericks' game against the Suns. Bayless called out Don\u010di\u0107's constant complaining as \"unbecoming\" and sided with the Suns' Devin Booker in their ongoing feud. The NBA analyst's comments have sparked a debate amongst basketball fans, with some agreeing with Bayless that Don\u010di\u0107's complaints were too much, while others believe it is part of the game. \n\nIn conclusion, Bayless has once again stirred controversy with his criticism of NBA players, but Davis and the Lakers remain focused on their season's ultimate goal: winning a championship. They know that they cannot waste any more games and that they will need Davis to continue his exceptional play if they are going to achieve success.
