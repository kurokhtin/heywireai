He scored just eight points in L.A.'s win over the Toronto Raptors on Friday, and although he was better versus the Knicks, he still didn't do enough. He shot 8-of-18 and missed four of his five free throws, which was a significant factor in his team's defeat and caused Bayless to blame him for the Lakers' inability to get the job done. AD failed to foul early in final Knicks possession. AD failed to take this game over the way he should have \u2013 former Laker Josh Hart ended it w 2 FTs. \u2014 Skip Bayless (@RealSkipBayless) March 13, 2023 It may not be fair to place all of the blame on Davis, however. The Knicks fronted him, swarmed him with defenders and didn't allow him to become entrenched in the paint like he normally does. After the game, Davis took responsibility for the loss , and he even said his teammates did what they needed to do to help L.A.'s cause.Anthony Davis was a force. With LeBron James on the bench in street clothes and a walking boot, Davis scored a game-high 39 points in the Lakers' 113-105 victory over the Golden State Warriors at Crypto.com Arena. The Lakers might have upgraded their roster last month, Davis might be carrying them in James' absence and the Western Conference might be wide open, but the team's fundamental problem remains the same.

Don\u010di\u0107' and Booker go into it once again during Sunday's game and Bayless said he was siding with Booker.He has carried the team through stretches without LeBron James, including over the past few weeks, during which he has shifted from MVP-caliber dominance to laudatory unselfishness. How The Atlanta Hawks Will Be CONTENDERS AD personally shouldered the blame for the Lakers' 112-108 loss to the New York Knicks , which halted a three-game winning streak and slowed the team's overall momentum (on a night when the New Orleans Pelicans and Oklahoma City Thunder earned Ws). I didn't do my job tonight.\u201d In the Lakers' win over the Toronto Raptors on Friday, Davis earned plaudits from Darvin Ham, D'Angelo Russell, and Austin Reaves for his \u201cselfless\u201d approach.

Meanwhile, Fox Sports 1 co-host Skip Bayless shifted his criticism towards another player, calling Dallas Mavericks' Luka Don\u010di\u0107 almost unwatchable due to his constant complaints to the referees during the game against Phoenix Suns on Monday.\n\nDespite Davis' 39 points performance which helped secure a victory over the Golden State Warriors last week, the Lakers continue to face issues as they struggle without LeBron James, who is currently on the bench due to injury. With the Western Conference wide open and the team's momentum slowing down after the loss to the Knicks, Davis acknowledges the importance of not wasting any more games and stepping up his game to carry the team.\n\nWhile Bayless' comments on Don\u010di\u0107 may be seen by some as harsh, they reflect the co-host's own opinion on the player's behavior on the court. Don\u010di\u0107 has been in an ongoing feud with Phoenix Suns' Devin Booker, and Bayless seems to side with Booker, not only due to his own dislike towards Don\u010di\u0107 but also because of the complaints he sees as unbecoming of a professional player.\n\nAs the NBA season continues, the focus for LA Lakers and Davis should be on improving their game and avoiding any more setbacks that might cost them a chance at the playoffs. While criticism from personalities like Bayless might be inevitable, it is ultimately up to the players and the team to use it as motivation to perform better on the court."]]}
