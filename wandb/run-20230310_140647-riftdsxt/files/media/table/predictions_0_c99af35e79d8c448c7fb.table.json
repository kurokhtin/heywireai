Mike LaFleur, offensive coordinator He's a branch off of Kyle Shanahan's coaching tree LaFleur was an offensive assistant with the Falcons from 2015-2016 when Shanahan was the offensive coordinator and then worked as the 49ers' passing game coordinator four years after Shanahan was hired as their head coach.

Gronk was an All-Pro in 2017 and though he missed time in 2018 due to injury, he helped lead the Patriots to a Super Bowl win over none other than the Rams. Chase Blackburn, special teams coordinator He won 2 Super Bowls as a linebacker with the Giants Blackburn was a linebacker with the Giants for eight years from 2005-2012, retiring as a member of the Panthers after a two-year stint from 2013-2014.The Miami Dolphins announced their 2023 coaching staff on Friday, just ahead of the start of the new league year next week. Along with Fangio, Miami hired offensive line coach Butch Barry, offensive assistant Max McCaffrey, assistant defensive line coach Kenny Baker, defensive assistant Steve Donatell, passing game coordinator/secondary Renaldo Hill, and safeties coach Joe Kasper this offseason.

He played wide receiver in the NFL, with stops with the Oakland Raiders, Green Bay Packers, New Orleans Saints, Jacksonville Jaguars, and San Francisco 49ers from 2016-2019. Donatell was a defensive quality control assistant for the Minnesota Vikings last season after having spent three years in the same position at Stanford. Hill joins the Dolphins for the third time after having been a safety for the team from 2006-2008, then serving as the assistant defensive backs coach in 2018. Slowick was a senior defensive assistant with the Dolphins in 2022 after having worked previously with the Denver Broncos, Arizona Cardinals, New York Jets, and Cleveland Browns.

Here is a closer look at the unique background of each member, starting with offensive coordinator Mike LaFleur.\n\nLaFleur is a known branch off of Kyle Shanahan's coaching tree. A former offensive assistant with the Falcons from 2015 to 2016, LaFleur worked under Shanahan, the offensive coordinator. Later, he became the 49ers' passing game coordinator, joining the team years after Shanahan was hired as the head coach. Before that, LaFleur served as a graduate assistant at the University of Kansas, eventually being given a chance by the Broncos. In 2017, he joined the Rams when Sean McVay became head coach, coaching the cornerbacks for five years, before moving on to other teams, including the Green Bay Packers and the Detroit Lions. Now, he has officially landed back in Los Angeles as the team's offensive coordinator.\n\nAnother crucial new hire by the Rams is tight end coach Nick Caley. With six seasons, he has worked with the New England Patriots as their tight end coach, including two years with Rob Gronkowski, who was at the top of the depth chart. Gronkowski was an All-Pro player in 2017 and played a significant part in the Patriots winning the Super Bowl over none other than the Rams.\n\nChase Blackburn, the new special teams coordinator, is a former Giants linebacker, playing for the team for eight years from 2005-2012. Blackburn even won two Super Bowls with the Giants! After leaving the team, he finished his career as a member of the Panthers. This experience will be invaluable to the Rams, considering special teams tend to get somewhat overlooked.\n\nAs for the defensive coordinator, Raheem Morris is returning to the role for a third year. He has done an exceptional job with the defense, and his continuing presence bodes well for the Rams. Morris worked alongside Lake back in 2007 while he was a defensive backs coach with the Buccaneers.\n\nAndrew Carter is joining the Rams' coaching staff as an assistant defensive line coach, having previously worked with Navy. In contrast, Joe Coniglio comes from the Denver Broncos and will be the team's new outside linebackers coach. Meanwhile, Eric Henderson, a defensive line coach, and run game coordinator, has had experience with the Rams before. He worked under Sean McVay as the team's assistant defensive line coach from 2018-2019.\n\nInside linebackers/pass rush coordinator Chris Shula, who was a defensive quality control assistant at Cal and coached linebackers and defensive ends at the University of Alabama, will be working under Morris. Nick Jones, a former University of Tennessee-Chattanooga wide receiver, will join the team as an offensive assistant, along with Zak Kromer, who will serve as the assistant offensive line coach. \n\nZac Robinson will be the quarterbacks' coach/passing game coordinator after previously serving as a senior advisor to the general manager for the San Francisco 49ers for more than a year. Ryan Wendell, a former New England Patriot, will coach the offensive line. Coach Jake Peetz (with experience in the NFL and at LSU) will be the team's pass game specialist.\n\nJeremy Springer will serve as assistant special teams coach, with Ron Gould as running backs coach. Eric Yarber, Florida Atlantic's former wide receiver coach who has coached in the NFL before, will coach the Rams' wide receivers. Chris Beake, who was a defensive quality control assistant for the Jets, will coach the secondary.\n\nFinally, assistant head coach Jimmy Lake is joining the team, having briefly worked with Morris in Tampa Bay in 2007. Lake previously served as the head coach at the University of Washington and will bring his invaluable experience with him.\n\nIn conclusion, the Rams' new coaching staff provides an exciting blend of fresh faces, solid experience, and outside thinking. With the team's outstanding season in 2021, optimism runs high for the upcoming year."]]}
