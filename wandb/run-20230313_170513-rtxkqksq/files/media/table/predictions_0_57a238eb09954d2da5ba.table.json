The defending Masters champion, who ended on 17-under par 271, will replace Spain's Jon Rahm atop the rankings on Monday. Scheffler began the day with a two-stroke lead over Lee, who immediately reduced the deficit with a birdie on the opening hole. Lee found the rough off the tee and took his medicine, chipping out back on to the fairway but that cautious decision was followed by his approach shot ending in the water. Hatton ended on 12-under par after his 65 with Norway's Viktor Hovland and American Tom Hoge tied for third, a further two strokes back. Japan's Hideki Matsuyama shot a four-under 68 to finish fifth, 9-under for the week, with his fine round undone by a double bogey on the 14th where he got in trouble in the rough. Scheffler rolled to an absolutely dominant five-shot win at The Players Championship on Sunday after tearing up TPC Sawgrass to claim the PGA Tour 's marquee tournament. It marked the sixth win of his career, and pushed him past Jon Rahm once again to retake the top spot in the Official World Golf Rankings.It was a wild a week at The PLAYERS Championship as Scottie Scheffler scored a 17-under par and cruised to a 5-shot victory over Tyrell Hatton on Sunday at TPC Sawgrass in Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla.

The defending Masters champion, who ended the tournament on 17-under par 271, will replace Spain's Jon Rahm atop the Official World Golf Rankings on Monday.\n\nIt was a victory of epic proportion, as the 24-year-old came out on top after five straight birdies between the eighth and 12th holes while his closest rival, Australian Min Woo Lee, imploded. It was a wild but heady week at The PLAYERS Championship, which was primarily fueled by Scheffler's final round score of 62 \u2014 one of the longest hole outs of the season \u2014 and his record-tying back-nine scoring of 7-under 29.\n\nThe man of the hour began the day with a two-stroke lead over Lee, whose day soon unraveled when he found the rough off the tee and had to chip out back onto the fairway \u2014 only to be followed by his approach shot that ended up in the water.\n\nAlthough he eventually recovered from his double bogey, Lee's lead-less state opened up the door for Scheffler's five-shot lead over Tyrrell Hatton and his eventual win. Hatton ended the day on 12-under par after his 65 and Norway's Viktor Hovland and American Tom Hoge tied for third place, two strokes behind.\n\nJapan's Hideki Matsuyama shot a four-under 68 to finish fifth on 9-under for the week, a fine round that was undone by a double bogey on the 14th hole after he got in trouble in the rough.\n\nScheffler's efforts are enough to put him past Rahm to officially become the World No.1. His win marks the sixth of his career and pushes him to collecting the largest individual check in professional golf history - to the tune of $4.5 million.\n\nHis first 5 wins have come in such a short amount of time, that Gene Frenette, a golf writer local to the Ponte Vedra Beach area, focused on Scheffler's victory, remarking on how impressive it is due to the man's achievements in the past 15 months.\n\nHe has earned 19 consecutive made cuts dating back to last season, and is ninth in strokes gained approach the green \u2014 being No.1 in strokes gained approach the green and fourth in proximity to the hole with Hoge, giving off a strong Tiger Woods-Phil Mickelson type of allegiance.\n\nKirk, meanwhile, still leads the PGA Tour in 3-putt avoidance - being second in approaches from 125-150 yards and 17th in total strokes gained - while fellow American Keegan Bradley, who won the ZOZO Championship during the Fall Swing, claimed four top-10s this season, including a second-place finish at the Farmers Insurance Open in January.\n\nIndia's, Siwoo Theegala, had his first career PGA Tour win in the American Express. and Xander Schauffele tied for T6 with Rory McIlroy, Jason Day and Chris Kirk. Rahm leads on the PGA Tour in scoring average, strokes gained total and leads the PGA Tour in greens in regulation percentage and bogey avoidance, while Day is second on the PGA Tour in scrambling and bogey avoidance and sixth in strokes gained total.\n\nOverall, the week saw an incredible display of top-tier golf, which made the fight for the final leader board position exciting to watch, and Scheffle's ascension to number one even more so. The victory should seal his status as a player to keep an eye on over the coming months, as he could be in a possible winning situation later this season.\n\nThe win also kicked off a month-long New Jersey festival that will bring music, comedy, tech innovation and more to stages and beaches across the state. The entertainment promises to feature a mix of both national superstars and local favorites, so it will truly be something special to look forward to.\n\nFor now, though, the world of professional golf \u2014 and Scottie Scheffler \u2014 is celebrating a special milestone in the form of a win at The PLAYERS Championship. Scheffler has joined some select World Golf Hall of Fame company in the way he posted a dominant five-shot victory over Tyrrell Hatton. He is a man who, in just 13 months, has not only won six major titles but also moved into third place behind Jon Rahm and Max Homa."]]}
