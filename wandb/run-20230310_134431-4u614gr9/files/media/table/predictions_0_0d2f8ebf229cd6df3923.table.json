The Los Angeles Rams probably won't be one of the more active teams this year, likely focusing on A) re-signing their own players and B) trimming their roster to free up cap space. Don't expect a big splash like last year when they landed Bobby Wagner and Allen Robinson, but each position has at least a few realistic targets for Los Angeles this offseason.

The other three picks are a result of the league's initiative that awards picks to the prior employer-club of a minority employee who has been hired by another club as its head coach or primary football executive.

They received a fourth-round pick at 135, two fifth-round picks at 172 and 180, a sixth-round pick at 194, and three seventh-round picks at 230, 240, and 247. \n\nThis influx of new talent will undoubtedly aid the Niners in their upcoming season, but they will have to carefully evaluate each pick to ensure they fit well with their current roster. \n\nIt's worth noting, however, that while the 49ers picked up seven selections, they weren't the only team to benefit from compensatory draft picks. \n\nThe Los Angeles Rams also received four overall picks, with two in the third round and two in the seventh round. The Browns and Chiefs each received third-round selections, while a handful of other teams received additional picks ranging from the fourth to seventh rounds. \n\nWith free agency fast approaching, it remains to be seen how these picks will shape each team's strategy for the upcoming season. The NFL is a constantly shifting landscape, and the addition of new talent is crucial to staying competitive. \n\nFor the 49ers, this newfound talent could be just what they need to make another run at the Super Bowl. As for the other teams, only time will tell if these picks pay off in the long run. \n\nBut one thing is for sure: with the announcement of these compensatory draft picks, the landscape of the NFL has once again shifted, and it's up to each team to adapt to the changes."]]}
