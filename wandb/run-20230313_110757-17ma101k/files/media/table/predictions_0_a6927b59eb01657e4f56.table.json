He scored just eight points in L.A.'s win over the Toronto Raptors on Friday, and although he was better versus the Knicks, he still didn't do enough. He shot 8-of-18 and missed four of his five free throws, which was a significant factor in his team's defeat and caused Bayless to blame him for the Lakers' inability to get the job done.

The Knicks fronted him, swarmed him with defenders and didn't allow him to become entrenched in the paint like he normally does. After the game, Davis took responsibility for the loss , and he even said his teammates did what they needed to do to help L.A.'s cause.Anthony Davis was a force. With LeBron James on the bench in street clothes and a walking boot, Davis scored a game-high 39 points in the Lakers' 113-105 victory over the Golden State Warriors at Crypto.com Arena. The Lakers might have upgraded their roster last month, Davis might be carrying them in James' absence and the Western Conference might be wide open, but the team's fundamental problem remains the same.

Bayless comments came on Monday after the Dallas Mavericks ' 130-126 loss against the Phoenix Suns Bayless's critique stems from Don\u010di\u0107's complaints to the referees during the aforementioned game which Bayless saw as constant and unbecoming. Bayless also commented on the ongoing feud between Don\u010di\u0107' and Suns guard Devin Booker which dates back to the 2022 NBA Playoffs. Don\u010di\u0107' and Booker go into it once again during Sunday's game and Bayless said he was siding with Booker.He has carried the team through stretches without LeBron James, including over the past few weeks, during which he has shifted from MVP-caliber dominance to laudatory unselfishness.

With teammate LeBron James out due to injury, Davis stepped up to score a game-high 39 points, showcasing his skills as a dominant force in the league. Despite Davis' impressive performance, Fox Sports 1 personality Skip Bayless was not impressed, shifting his criticism from LeBron James to Davis. \n\nBayless, a harsh critic of James, took to Twitter on Sunday after the Lakers' 112-108 loss to the New York Knicks, placing the blame for the defeat solely on Davis. \"AD failed to take this game over the way he should have,\" Bayless tweeted. \"He scored 39 points in the win over Golden State on Saturday, but he needed to do more against the Knicks.\" \n\nWhile it may be easy to place the blame on Davis, the Knicks played exceptionally well on defense, restricting Davis' movement and not allowing him to dominate in the paint as he normally would. Davis himself took responsibility for the loss after the game, stating, \"I didn't do my job tonight,\" but he also credited his teammates for their support. \"I can't put it all on myself,\" Davis said. \n\nBayless' criticism wasn't limited to Davis, however. On Monday, he voiced his displeasure with Dallas Mavericks star Luka Don\u010di\u0107 as well. Bayless commented on Don\u010di\u0107's constant complaints to referees during the Mavericks' 130-126 loss to the Phoenix Suns on Sunday, which he found \"unbecoming.\" Bayless also sided with Suns guard Devin Booker in his ongoing feud with Don\u010di\u0107. \n\nDespite Bayless' constant critiques, Davis remains a key player for the Lakers, shouldering much of the team's scoring and defensive responsibilities. In recent games, he has shifted from MVP-caliber performances to a more selfless approach, as he demonstrated in the Lakers' win over the Toronto Raptors on Friday, when he earned praise for his \"selfless\" play. \n\nAlthough the Lakers have struggled this season, many analysts still view them as a playoff contender, especially with James set to return from injury soon. With Davis carrying much of the team's weight, the Lakers will continue to rely on his performance as they fight to stay in the playoff race in the competitive Western Conference. \n\nAs for Bayless, it seems his criticisms will continue, even if they are unwarranted or unfair. But for Lakers fans, the focus remains on the team's success and the hope that Davis and the rest of the squad can carry them to victory in the remaining games of the season."]]}
