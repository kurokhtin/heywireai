Please make sure the story you generate is at least 500 words long.\nOriginal example: EL SEGUNDO, Calif. -- D'Angelo Russell is expected to make his return to the lineup Friday against the Toronto Raptors following a six-game absence because of a right ankle sprain, Los Angeles Lakers coach Darvin Ham said. Russell, who has been limited to contract drills with the coaches and no full team scrimmages during his ramp up to return, did not sound concerned about jumping back into action. The point guard will resume his spot in the starting backcourt, sending Dennis Schroder to the bench unit. \"I know starting is a big deal to a lot of people, but at the end of the day, finishing lineup is probably a little bit more important and Dennis will definitely be in the mix,\" Ham said of Schroder. Russell has averaged 13.5 points and 5.0 assists in four games for L.A. since being acquired from the Minnesota Timberwolves at the trade deadline. Schroder averaged 14.3 points and 8.5 assists while Russell rehabbed his ankle, helping lead the Lakers to a 4-2 record in that span, while the team was also missing LeBron James (right foot injury) for five of those games. As Russell prepares for a return, the Lakers announced Thursday that backup center Mo Bamba will be out another two weeks before being re-evaluated with a high left ankle sprain. Russell likened the upcoming stretch to a team starting the playoffs, needing to secure 16 wins to earn the title.For the first time since Feb. 23, when he twisted his right ankle stepping on the foot of Golden State\u2019s Donte DiVincenzo, Russell is expected to take the court again for the Lakers on Friday night against Toronto. The Lakers have had a rough run of injuries since the trade deadline, the most significant being Russell and LeBron James, who is out for at least two more weeks and possibly longer. The team got more unwelcome news on Thursday when they acknowledged that center Mo Bamba, another one of their deadline acquisitions, will miss the next four weeks with a high left ankle sprain \u2013 essentially the remainder of the regular season. Still, that hasn\u2019t slowed them down: The Lakers are 7-3 since changing over their roster at the deadline, have yet to lose back-to-back games and have a 107.6 defensive rating over that stretch \u2013 the best mark in the NBA. Adding Russell, who is averaging 6 assists and shooting nearly 39% from 3-point range, to that mix should liven up the group\u2019s potential even more, Coach Darvin Ham said. Russell\u2019s return puts Schr\u00f6der back into a reserve role, but not out of the mix to close games, Ham said. The two players have a plus-5.0 net rating when they share the court, and with a few complementary skillsets and their collective competitiveness, Ham said he thinks they\u2019ll bring some fire despite being shifted elsewhere in the rotation. The Lakers have been able to enjoy finally cracking into play-in territory after beating Memphis on Tuesday, but they know that means little in a tightly-packed Western Conference standings battle with just 16 games remaining.After going through a full practice Thursday, D\u2019Angelo Russell will be available to play for the Lakers on Friday against the Toronto Raptors at Crypto.com Arena after missing the last six games with a sprained right ankle. Russell said he was \u201cgood\u201d and ready\u201d after sitting out the last two weeks to let his ankle heal. Russell was injured Feb. 23 against the Golden State Warriors in a freak accident. While taking the ball out of bounds after a Warriors basket, Russell stepped back and onto the foot of Golden State\u2019s Donte DiVincenzo. In his four games with the Lakers since being acquired from the Minnesota Timberwolves, Russell averaged 13.5 points and 5.0 assists. Ham said he and his medical staff will discuss how many minutes Russell will be able to play against the Raptors. Ham said Russell will start and that Dennis Schroder will return to his role as a spark plug off the bench. \u201cAgain, like I say, I know starting is a big deal to a lot of people, but at the end of the day, finishing lineup is probably a little bit more important and Dennis will definitely be in the mix.\u201d\n Entities: - EL SEGUNDO: Location\n- Dennis: Human\n- D'Angelo Russell: Human\n- Toronto: Local_government\n- Memphis: Political_organisation\n- Crypto.com Arena: Organization\n- Bane: Human\n- Minnesota Timberwolves: Organization\n- Toronto Raptors: Organization\n- EL SEGUNDO: Organization\n- Ham: Product_(business)\n- Bane: Software\n- NBA: Business\n- Western Conference: Location\n- Memphis: Local_government\n- Russell: Human\n- Anthony Davis: Human\n- Minnesota Timberwolves: Nonprofit_organization\n- Western Conference: Organization\n- Toronto Raptors: Nonprofit_organization\n- NBA: Nonprofit_organization\n- Schr\u00f6der: Human\n- Golden State: Nonprofit_organization\n- Los Angeles: Political_organisation\n- James: Human\n- LeBron James: Human\n- Lakers: Organization\n- Darvin Ham: Human\n- Mo Bamba: Human\n- plus-5.0: Location\n- Dennis Schroder: Human\n- Desmond: Human\n- Vanderbilt: Business\n- Lakers: Nonprofit_organization\n- \u201cMan: Human\n- Donte DiVincenzo: Human\n- Austin Reaves: Human\n- Dennis Schr\u00f6der: Human\n- Vanderbilt: Nonprofit_organization\n- Still: Human\n- Calif.: U.S._state\n- Advertisement\n\nRussell: Human\n\nBegin story:", {"prompt_tokens": 1236, "completion_tokens": 583, "total_tokens": 1819}, "\"The Return of Russell: Lakers' Star Point Guard Makes Comeback Against Toronto\"\n\nIt was a long six games for the Lakers without their star point guard, D'Angelo Russell. But the wait was finally over as Russell made his much-anticipated comeback against the Toronto Raptors at the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles.\n\nThe Lakers had suffered a spate of injuries since the trade deadline, with LeBron James out with a right foot injury, and Mo Bamba with a high left ankle sprain. The team battled on, however, and to their credit, were 7-3 since the roster changes at the deadline.\n\nCoach Darvin Ham was excited to welcome his star point guard back into the starting lineup as they took on the Toronto Raptors. Ham had been impressed with the resilience of the team, especially Dennis Schroder, who had stepped up in Russell's absence.\n\nRussell was optimistic about his injury and had been making steady progress during his rehab. \"I know starting is a big deal to a lot of people, but at the end of the day, the finishing lineup is probably a little bit more important, and Dennis will definitely be in the mix,\" said Ham.\n\nThe Lakers didn't disappoint in the early going as Russell looked comfortable in his return. His signature jump shot was back on full display, and it was sweet music to Lakers fans' ears. The team raced to an early lead and never looked back, thanks to some (adjective) performances by Anthony Davis, Schroder, and Russell.\n\nToronto tried to make a comeback in the fourth quarter, but Russell was having none of it. He made a pivotal play, driving to the basket and drawing the foul, much to the delight of the fans. The Lakers held on for a hard-fought 110-103 victory over Toronto.\n\n\"That's the kind of resilience we've shown all season long,\" said Ham. \"Even with all the injuries and setbacks, the team has never given up.\"\n\nRussell was overjoyed with his performance in his return. \"I've been itching to get back out there and playing with my teammates,\" he said. \"It feels so good to be back.\"\n\nThe Lakers have looked like a completely revamped team since the deadline, and with Russell back in the lineup, their championship aspirations look even more realistic. The Western Conference is stacked with quality teams, but the Lakers and Russell are up for the challenge.\n\nThe playoffs are just around the corner, and the Lakers know they must continue to work hard to secure a high seed. They face Memphis next, and the Lakers know they cannot afford to let up. \"We have to treat every game like it's a playoff game,\" said Schroder.\n\nThe Lakers are a team on a mission, and with Russell back in the lineup, their chances of hoisting the championship trophy at the end of the season look better than ever before."]]}
