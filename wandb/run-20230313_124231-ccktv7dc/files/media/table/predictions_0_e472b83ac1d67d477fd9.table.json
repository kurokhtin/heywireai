March 13 (Reuters) - SVB Financial Group (SIVB.O) and two top executives were sued on Monday by shareholders who accused them of concealing how rising interest rates would leave its Silicon Valley Bank unit, which failed last week, \"particularly susceptible\" to a bank run. It appeared to be the first of many likely lawsuits over the demise of Silicon Valley Bank, which U.S. regulators seized on March 10 following a surge of deposit withdrawals. SVB had surprised the market two days earlier by disclosing a $1.8 billion after-tax loss from investment sales and that it planned to raise capital, as it scrambled to meet redemption requests. Its collapse has sparked fears of contagion among other lenders that also cater to wealthy clients, including technology start-ups and venture capital-backed companies, as well as large regional banks. In Monday's lawsuit, shareholders led by Chandra Vanipenta said Santa Clara, California-based SVB failed to disclose how rising interest rates would undermine its business model, and leave it worse off than banks with different client bases. The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages for SVB investors between June 16, 2021 and March 10, 2023. SVB said on Monday it will explore strategic alternatives for what remains of the company, now shorn of its main banking business.(Adds background about bank's collapse, contagion fears, shareholder claims, case citation) March 13 (Reuters) - SVB Financial Group and two top executives were sued on Monday by shareholders who accused them of concealing how rising interest rates would leave its Silicon Valley Bank unit, which failed last week, \"particularly susceptible\" to a bank run.

Two days prior, SVB had announced a $1.8 billion after-tax loss from investment sales alongside capital-raising efforts to meet redemption requests. The U.S. Federal Reserve had hoped that the seizure of SVB would contain any possible contagion to other lenders, thus preserving the financial state of wealthy clients and venture capital-backed companies.\n\nHowever, such hopes were quickly put to rest when shares led by Chandra Vanipenta initiated a class-action lawsuit on Monday against SVB Financial Group, Chief Executive Greg Becker, and Chief Financial Officer Daniel Beck. The federal court in San Jose, California heard the lawsuit, which accused the executives of failing to disclose the increased risk associated with rising interest rates and how it would compromise SVB's business model, making it more vulnerable to a bank run compared to banks of different clientele. Shareholders are requesting unspecified damages for SVB investors from the period of June 16, 2021 to March 10, 2023.\n\nAccording to Nathan Frandino, a Silicon Valley correspondent for Reuters and a sworn witness for the proposed class action, SVB finally admitted during the trial that it had been aware of the changing macro trends and the associated risk.\n\n\"SVB's executives knew the extent of their high exposure to potential insolvency but chose to manipulate the stock and put forth false public statements to give the appearance that the bank was in sound financial health,\" said Jonathan Stempel, a lawyer for the plaintiffs and partner at San Francisco law firm Lieff Cabraser Heimann & Bernstein.\n\nThe class-action lawsuit followed SVB's decision to begin exploring strategic alternatives in the wake of its banking division's collapse. Meanwhile, SVB said in a press release it \"intends to vigorously defend itself against these baseless claims\" and stands by its actions, conduct, and disclosure throughout the period in question. Currently, the case is pending in the Northern District of the District Court of San Jose.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether other lawsuits from shareholders of Silicon Valley Bank will follow. Stay tuned for further updates as this story develops. \n\nSVB Executives Accused of Failing to Disclose Risks from Rising Interest Rates"]]}
