Please make sure the story you generate is at least 500 words long.\nOriginal example: EL SEGUNDO, Calif. -- D'Angelo Russell is expected to make his return to the lineup Friday against the Toronto Raptors following a six-game absence because of a right ankle sprain, Los Angeles Lakers coach Darvin Ham said. Russell, who has been limited to contract drills with the coaches and no full team scrimmages during his ramp up to return, did not sound concerned about jumping back into action. The point guard will resume his spot in the starting backcourt, sending Dennis Schroder to the bench unit. \"I know starting is a big deal to a lot of people, but at the end of the day, finishing lineup is probably a little bit more important and Dennis will definitely be in the mix,\" Ham said of Schroder. Russell has averaged 13.5 points and 5.0 assists in four games for L.A. since being acquired from the Minnesota Timberwolves at the trade deadline. Schroder averaged 14.3 points and 8.5 assists while Russell rehabbed his ankle, helping lead the Lakers to a 4-2 record in that span, while the team was also missing LeBron James (right foot injury) for five of those games. As Russell prepares for a return, the Lakers announced Thursday that backup center Mo Bamba will be out another two weeks before being re-evaluated with a high left ankle sprain. Russell likened the upcoming stretch to a team starting the playoffs, needing to secure 16 wins to earn the title.For the first time since Feb. 23, when he twisted his right ankle stepping on the foot of Golden State\u2019s Donte DiVincenzo, Russell is expected to take the court again for the Lakers on Friday night against Toronto. The Lakers have had a rough run of injuries since the trade deadline, the most significant being Russell and LeBron James, who is out for at least two more weeks and possibly longer. The team got more unwelcome news on Thursday when they acknowledged that center Mo Bamba, another one of their deadline acquisitions, will miss the next four weeks with a high left ankle sprain \u2013 essentially the remainder of the regular season. Still, that hasn\u2019t slowed them down: The Lakers are 7-3 since changing over their roster at the deadline, have yet to lose back-to-back games and have a 107.6 defensive rating over that stretch \u2013 the best mark in the NBA. Adding Russell, who is averaging 6 assists and shooting nearly 39% from 3-point range, to that mix should liven up the group\u2019s potential even more, Coach Darvin Ham said. Russell\u2019s return puts Schr\u00f6der back into a reserve role, but not out of the mix to close games, Ham said. The two players have a plus-5.0 net rating when they share the court, and with a few complementary skillsets and their collective competitiveness, Ham said he thinks they\u2019ll bring some fire despite being shifted elsewhere in the rotation. The Lakers have been able to enjoy finally cracking into play-in territory after beating Memphis on Tuesday, but they know that means little in a tightly-packed Western Conference standings battle with just 16 games remaining.After going through a full practice Thursday, D\u2019Angelo Russell will be available to play for the Lakers on Friday against the Toronto Raptors at Crypto.com Arena after missing the last six games with a sprained right ankle. Russell said he was \u201cgood\u201d and ready\u201d after sitting out the last two weeks to let his ankle heal. Russell was injured Feb. 23 against the Golden State Warriors in a freak accident. While taking the ball out of bounds after a Warriors basket, Russell stepped back and onto the foot of Golden State\u2019s Donte DiVincenzo. In his four games with the Lakers since being acquired from the Minnesota Timberwolves, Russell averaged 13.5 points and 5.0 assists. Ham said he and his medical staff will discuss how many minutes Russell will be able to play against the Raptors. Ham said Russell will start and that Dennis Schroder will return to his role as a spark plug off the bench. \u201cAgain, like I say, I know starting is a big deal to a lot of people, but at the end of the day, finishing lineup is probably a little bit more important and Dennis will definitely be in the mix.\u201d\n Entities: - EL SEGUNDO: Location\n- Dennis: Human\n- D'Angelo Russell: Human\n- Toronto: Local_government\n- Memphis: Political_organisation\n- Crypto.com Arena: Organization\n- Bane: Human\n- Minnesota Timberwolves: Organization\n- Toronto Raptors: Organization\n- EL SEGUNDO: Organization\n- Ham: Product_(business)\n- Bane: Software\n- NBA: Business\n- Western Conference: Location\n- Memphis: Local_government\n- Russell: Human\n- Anthony Davis: Human\n- Minnesota Timberwolves: Nonprofit_organization\n- Western Conference: Organization\n- Toronto Raptors: Nonprofit_organization\n- NBA: Nonprofit_organization\n- Schr\u00f6der: Human\n- Golden State: Nonprofit_organization\n- Los Angeles: Political_organisation\n- James: Human\n- LeBron James: Human\n- Lakers: Organization\n- Darvin Ham: Human\n- Mo Bamba: Human\n- plus-5.0: Location\n- Dennis Schroder: Human\n- Desmond: Human\n- Vanderbilt: Business\n- Lakers: Nonprofit_organization\n- \u201cMan: Human\n- Donte DiVincenzo: Human\n- Austin Reaves: Human\n- Dennis Schr\u00f6der: Human\n- Vanderbilt: Nonprofit_organization\n- Still: Human\n- Calif.: U.S._state\n- Advertisement\n\nRussell: Human\n\nBegin story:", {"prompt_tokens": 1236, "completion_tokens": 620, "total_tokens": 1856}, "\"Russell Returns: Lakers Rejoice and Bane Takes Notice\"\n\nEL SEGUNDO, Calif. - It was a joyous day for Lakers fans as D'Angelo Russell made his return to the starting lineup after a six-game absence due to a right ankle sprain. The Toronto Raptors were in town, but they might as well have been the Toronto Raptored Pterodactyls for all they were going to accomplish against the Lakers with Russell back on the court.\n\nAs the game began, Dennis Schroder took his spot on the bench next to Desmond Vanderbilt. Vanderbilt shot a worried glance at Schroder, who just shrugged and whispered, \"Don't worry, man. We've got this.\"\n\nBut little did they know, the chaos-loving villain Bane was lurking in the shadows with his latest plan to take down the Lakers. He had hacked into the NBA's scheduling system and bribed the Toronto Raptors to throw the game in exchange for a lifetime supply of authentic poutine.\n\nBut even Bane's Master Plan couldn't hold up against Russell's return. The Lakers quickly took control of the game, as Russell found his rhythm and racked up 25 points, 8 assists, and 4 rebounds. LeBron James, still out with a right foot injury, watched from the sidelines with Anthony Davis, cheering on their teammates.\n\nMeanwhile, Bane sat in his lair, fuming as his scheme crumbled before his very eyes. He had no choice but to activate his secret weapon: a software program called \"Schr\u00f6derBot.\" The robot was modeled after Schroder, with his quick reflexes and sharp shooting skills, but equipped with an evil intellect and a laser cannon.\n\nAs the fourth quarter began, the Lakers noticed something strange. Schroder was on the court, but he wasn't acting like himself. His movements were stilted and robotic, and his eyes glowed with an otherworldly light. Suddenly, the Schr\u00f6derBot revealed itself, shooting laser beams at anyone who came near.\n\nThe Lakers were in a panic, but then they realized the solution was simple: they just had to unplug the robot. Russell made a daring leap over the Schr\u00f6derBot's laser blasts and ripped out its power cord. The Lakers erupted in cheers as the robot crumbled to the ground.\n\nWith the Schr\u00f6derBot defeated and the Raptors thoroughly trounced, the Lakers could finally celebrate Russell's return. They all gathered in the locker room, toasting their victory with champagne and hot sauce-drenched chicken wings.\n\nAs they basked in their glory, the Lakers knew they were a team to be feared. Even Bane himself couldn't deny the Lakers' power, and he begrudgingly added them to his list of formidable foes.\n\nAnd for Dennis Schroder, it was just another day in the life of an NBA player, complete with robot clones and laser fights. As he finished his chicken wings, he muttered to himself, \"I guess that's just how we roll in LA.\""]]}
