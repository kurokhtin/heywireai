With the Rams finalizing their coaching staff this week, get to know the newcomers with one fact about each. Mike LaFleur, offensive coordinator He's a branch off of Kyle Shanahan's coaching tree LaFleur was an offensive assistant with the Falcons from 2015-2016 when Shanahan was the offensive coordinator and then worked as the 49ers' passing game coordinator four years after Shanahan was hired as their head coach. Previously, he was a graduate assistant at the University of Kansas before the Broncos gave him a shot. He joined the Rams in 2017 when Sean McVay was hired, coaching the cornerbacks for five years. He left in 2021 to become the Lions' DBs coach and pass game coordinator, but he was fired in 2022. Late last season, he joined the Packers as an offensive consultant but has made his way back to L.A. Nick Caley, TEs coach He coached Gronk and the Patriots' TEs from 2017-2022 Caley was the Patriots' tight ends coach for six seasons, which included two years with Rob Gronkowski atop the depth chart. Gronk was an All-Pro in 2017 and though he missed time in 2018 due to injury, he helped lead the Patriots to a Super Bowl win over none other than the Rams. Chase Blackburn, special teams coordinator He won 2 Super Bowls as a linebacker with the Giants Blackburn was a linebacker with the Giants for eight years from 2005-2012, retiring as a member of the Panthers after a two-year stint from 2013-2014.The Miami Dolphins announced their 2023 coaching staff on Friday, just ahead of the start of the new league year next week. Along with Fangio, Miami hired offensive line coach Butch Barry, offensive assistant Max McCaffrey, assistant defensive line coach Kenny Baker, defensive assistant Steve Donatell, passing game coordinator/secondary Renaldo Hill, and safeties coach Joe Kasper this offseason. Barry joins the Dolphins after having been the Denver Broncos \u2019 offensive line coach last year. He played wide receiver in the NFL, with stops with the Oakland Raiders, Green Bay Packers, New Orleans Saints, Jacksonville Jaguars, and San Francisco 49ers from 2016-2019. Donatell was a defensive quality control assistant for the Minnesota Vikings last season after having spent three years in the same position at Stanford. Hill joins the Dolphins for the third time after having been a safety for the team from 2006-2008, then serving as the assistant defensive backs coach in 2018. Slowick was a senior defensive assistant with the Dolphins in 2022 after having worked previously with the Denver Broncos, Arizona Cardinals, New York Jets, and Cleveland Browns. He played safety in the NFL from 2014-2021, primarily with the Atlanta Falcons before his last year with the Carolina Panthers.His finalized staff includes 10 new hires, plus 11 returnees.

He worked alongside current Rams defensive coordinator Raheem Morris in Tampa Bay in 2007 when Morris was in his first season as the Bucs' defensive backs coach.
