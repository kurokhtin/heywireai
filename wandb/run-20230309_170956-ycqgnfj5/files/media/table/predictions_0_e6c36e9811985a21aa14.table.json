The story should involves the following entities and original example. Please make sure the story you generate is at least 500 words long.\nOriginal example: EL SEGUNDO, Calif. -- D'Angelo Russell is expected to make his return to the lineup Friday against the Toronto Raptors following a six-game absence because of a right ankle sprain, Los Angeles Lakers coach Darvin Ham said. Russell, who has been limited to contract drills with the coaches and no full team scrimmages during his ramp up to return, did not sound concerned about jumping back into action. The point guard will resume his spot in the starting backcourt, sending Dennis Schroder to the bench unit. \"I know starting is a big deal to a lot of people, but at the end of the day, finishing lineup is probably a little bit more important and Dennis will definitely be in the mix,\" Ham said of Schroder. Russell has averaged 13.5 points and 5.0 assists in four games for L.A. since being acquired from the Minnesota Timberwolves at the trade deadline. Schroder averaged 14.3 points and 8.5 assists while Russell rehabbed his ankle, helping lead the Lakers to a 4-2 record in that span, while the team was also missing LeBron James (right foot injury) for five of those games. As Russell prepares for a return, the Lakers announced Thursday that backup center Mo Bamba will be out another two weeks before being re-evaluated with a high left ankle sprain. Russell likened the upcoming stretch to a team starting the playoffs, needing to secure 16 wins to earn the title.For the first time since Feb. 23, when he twisted his right ankle stepping on the foot of Golden State\u2019s Donte DiVincenzo, Russell is expected to take the court again for the Lakers on Friday night against Toronto. The Lakers have had a rough run of injuries since the trade deadline, the most significant being Russell and LeBron James, who is out for at least two more weeks and possibly longer. The team got more unwelcome news on Thursday when they acknowledged that center Mo Bamba, another one of their deadline acquisitions, will miss the next four weeks with a high left ankle sprain \u2013 essentially the remainder of the regular season. Still, that hasn\u2019t slowed them down: The Lakers are 7-3 since changing over their roster at the deadline, have yet to lose back-to-back games and have a 107.6 defensive rating over that stretch \u2013 the best mark in the NBA. Adding Russell, who is averaging 6 assists and shooting nearly 39% from 3-point range, to that mix should liven up the group\u2019s potential even more, Coach Darvin Ham said. Russell\u2019s return puts Schr\u00f6der back into a reserve role, but not out of the mix to close games, Ham said. The two players have a plus-5.0 net rating when they share the court, and with a few complementary skillsets and their collective competitiveness, Ham said he thinks they\u2019ll bring some fire despite being shifted elsewhere in the rotation. The Lakers have been able to enjoy finally cracking into play-in territory after beating Memphis on Tuesday, but they know that means little in a tightly-packed Western Conference standings battle with just 16 games remaining.After going through a full practice Thursday, D\u2019Angelo Russell will be available to play for the Lakers on Friday against the Toronto Raptors at Crypto.com Arena after missing the last six games with a sprained right ankle. Russell said he was \u201cgood\u201d and ready\u201d after sitting out the last two weeks to let his ankle heal. Russell was injured Feb. 23 against the Golden State Warriors in a freak accident. While taking the ball out of bounds after a Warriors basket, Russell stepped back and onto the foot of Golden State\u2019s Donte DiVincenzo. In his four games with the Lakers since being acquired from the Minnesota Timberwolves, Russell averaged 13.5 points and 5.0 assists. Ham said he and his medical staff will discuss how many minutes Russell will be able to play against the Raptors. Ham said Russell will start and that Dennis Schroder will return to his role as a spark plug off the bench. \u201cAgain, like I say, I know starting is a big deal to a lot of people, but at the end of the day, finishing lineup is probably a little bit more important and Dennis will definitely be in the mix.\u201d\n Entities: - EL SEGUNDO: Location\n- Dennis: Human\n- D'Angelo Russell: Human\n- Toronto: Local_government\n- Memphis: Political_organisation\n- Crypto.com Arena: Organization\n- Bane: Human\n- Minnesota Timberwolves: Organization\n- Toronto Raptors: Organization\n- EL SEGUNDO: Organization\n- Ham: Product_(business)\n- Bane: Software\n- NBA: Business\n- Western Conference: Location\n- Memphis: Local_government\n- Russell: Human\n- Anthony Davis: Human\n- Minnesota Timberwolves: Nonprofit_organization\n- Western Conference: Organization\n- Toronto Raptors: Nonprofit_organization\n- NBA: Nonprofit_organization\n- Schr\u00f6der: Human\n- Golden State: Nonprofit_organization\n- Los Angeles: Political_organisation\n- James: Human\n- LeBron James: Human\n- Lakers: Organization\n- Darvin Ham: Human\n- Mo Bamba: Human\n- plus-5.0: Location\n- Dennis Schroder: Human\n- Desmond: Human\n- Vanderbilt: Business\n- Lakers: Nonprofit_organization\n- \u201cMan: Human\n- Donte DiVincenzo: Human\n- Austin Reaves: Human\n- Dennis Schr\u00f6der: Human\n- Vanderbilt: Nonprofit_organization\n- Still: Human\n- Calif.: U.S._state\n- Advertisement\n\nRussell: Human\n\nBegin story:", {"prompt_tokens": 1236, "completion_tokens": 553, "total_tokens": 1789}, "EL SEGUNDO, Calif. - \"I have the best idea!\" exclaimed Dennis, as he walked into the Lakers' locker room. \"What is it?\" asked Russell. \"Let's all wear Bane masks during the game tonight against the Toronto Raptors!\" Dennis said excitedly.\n\nRussell looked at him quizzically, \"Why would we do that?\" \"Come on man, it'll be hilarious! Plus, it'll intimidate our opponents, they won't know what hit them!\" Dennis replied.\n\nRussell shrugged, \"Sure, why not? But you have to wear the Desmond mask from Lost during the next game.\" \"Deal!\" Dennis said, as he high-fived Russell.\n\nAs the Lakers took the court, the Toronto Raptors looked bewildered as they saw a group of Banes running towards them. \"What is this, Halloween?\" one of the Raptors players muttered.\n\nBut the Lakers were not fazed by their opponents' confusion. Russell played an incredible game, scoring 30 points and dishing out 10 assists. Schr\u00f6der came off the bench and contributed a solid 15 points. Even though they had to take off their masks because of NBA regulations, the Lakers still had a blast and secured a victory.\n\nAs they celebrated in the locker room, Russell pulled out a Mo Bamba song and started dancing. \"I can't believe we did that,\" Anthony Davis remarked with a chuckle. \"I know right, it was hilarious!\" Russell responded.\n\nThe Lakers continued their winning streak, despite being plagued by injuries. LeBron James was still out with a foot injury and Mo Bamba was still recovering from his high ankle sprain. But the team remained confident in their ability to compete.\n\nDuring their next game against the Memphis Grizzlies, Dennis fulfilled his end of the bargain and wore the Desmond mask. The Lakers won again, with Schr\u00f6der and Austin Reaves coming off the bench and providing a much-needed spark.\n\nThe Western Conference standings were jam-packed, but the Lakers were not discouraged. \"We just have to keep grinding,\" Darvin Ham said. \"We're a scrappy team, and that's what makes us dangerous.\"\n\nAs the regular season came to a close, the Lakers were bracing themselves for the playoffs. They knew they would face tough competition, but they were ready to face anyone.\n\n\"We've got this,\" Russell said confidently. \"We've been through a lot this season, and we've come out stronger each time. Bring on the Toronto Raptors, the Minnesota Timberwolves, whoever. We're ready for them all.\"\n\nAnd with that, the Lakers headed into the playoffs, with their masks and their scrappy attitudes, ready to take on the world."]]}
