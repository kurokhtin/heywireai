George Santos is denying the latest fraud claim against him, saying reports that he orchestrated a credit card scam are untrue. In a sworn statement, first reported by Politico, a former roommate accused Santos of orchestrating a skimming operation in Seattle to steal information from ATM and credit cards. \"I am coming forward today to declare that the person in charge of the crime of credit card fraud when I was arrested was George Santos / Anthony Devolder,\" Gustavo Ribeiro Trelha wrote in a sworn statement, according to Politico. \"Santos voluntarily surrendered two cellphones at the Secret Service's New York field office, where the interview took place,\" CBS News reported, citing two sources familiar with the investigation. During the hearing, Santos can be heard in court audio falsely telling the judge that he was employed at the investment firm Goldman Sachs. The latest report follows a wave of state and federal investigations into Santos, who is facing legal scrutiny and public pressure for lying about his personal and professional biography. Lies range from saying he was a volleyball star and graduated from a college he never attended to work experience and a crafted Jewish ancestry. The House Ethics Committee last week launched an investigation into whether Santos engaged in \"unlawful activity\" during his campaign and since taking office.WASHINGTON\u2013Embattled Rep.

George Santos continues to deny any wrongdoing regarding the latest ATM scam and credit card skimming operation accusations. Despite evidence to the contrary, Santos maintains his innocence and has launched a Twitter campaign to push back against his critics.\n\nThe accusations stem from a sworn statement by Gustavo Ribeiro Trelha, a former roommate of Santos, who claims the Congressman was the mastermind behind a Seattle-based operation to steal information from ATM and credit cards. Trelha's statement has led to calls for Santos to step down from Congress and face legal repercussions.\n\nSantos, however, vehemently denies the allegations, accusing his detractors of a smear campaign fueled by political motivations. He has taken to Twitter to express his innocence and rally his supporters with the hashtag #IStandWithGeorge.\n\nThe House Ethics Committee has launched an investigation into Santos' alleged unlawful activity, including unanswered questions about his campaign finances. Meanwhile, the Federal Election Commission has received multiple complaints about Santos' campaign finances, adding to his mounting legal troubles.\n\nDespite these developments, Santos maintains his innocence, casting himself as a victim of political persecution. \"I will not be silenced by fake news or political witch hunts,\" he tweeted on Thursday. \"I am innocent, and I will fight to clear my name.\"\n\nThis latest scandal is just the most recent in a string of legal and ethical controversies surrounding Santos. He has faced criticism for lying about his personal and professional background, including false claims about his education, work experience, and even his ancestry.\n\nCritics have called Santos a \"sick puppy\" and a \"sociopath\" for his alleged criminal activities and dishonest behavior. Even Republican leaders, including Mitt Romney, have called for Santos to resign from Congress.\n\nAs the investigation into Santos' alleged wrongdoing continues, the nation watches to see whether justice will prevail or political maneuvering will protect the Congressman from facing the consequences of his alleged misconduct."]]}
