The former first-round draft pick by the Chicago Bears signed with the Rams in free agency in 2020, but after just one season, the team has decided to move on. The Rams are faced with the daunting task of reducing their salary cap before the start of the new league year on March 15, and Floyd's release is just the latest move in their cost-cutting efforts. \n\nFloyd was productive during his time with the Bears, notching 18.5 sacks in four seasons, but he didn't quite replicate that level of success in Los Angeles. Despite the Rams' struggles in 2020 following their Super Bowl appearance the year prior, Floyd still managed to tally 10.5 sacks and 55 tackles. His release will save the Rams $13.5 million against the cap, but it's another blow to the team's defense that has already seen the departures of defensive tackle Michael Brockers and safety John Johnson III.\n\nThe Rams are in a tough spot financially, thanks in part to the blockbuster trade that brought quarterback Matthew Stafford to Los Angeles. The team has also handed out massive contracts to stars like Jalen Ramsey and Aaron Donald. But while the Rams are looking to reduce salary, they're also trying to build a championship-caliber squad. That's a delicate balance, and it will be interesting to see how things shake out for head coach Sean McVay and general manager Les Snead as they try to navigate these tricky waters.\n\nFor fans of the Chicago Bears, Floyd's release is a reminder of what could have been. The team is still looking for a long-term solution at outside linebacker, and Floyd was a promising young player just a few years ago. Of course, the Bears have other concerns to address, namely the uncertain future of star wide receiver Allen Robinson. It's unclear whether the team will use the franchise tag to keep Robinson in Chicago, but if they don't, he'll be one of the top free agents on the market.\n\nAs for Floyd, his release undoubtedly came as a surprise. He had performed well enough to earn a sizable contract from the Rams, but sometimes it just doesn't work out. Perhaps he'll latch on with another team, or maybe he'll head back to Chicago to prove himself all over again. Either way, his time in Los Angeles is over, and it's on to the next chapter of his NFL career.\n\nIn the meantime, fans can stay up to date on all the latest NFL news and analysis by tuning in to ESPN, NBC Sports Chicago, and other outlets.
