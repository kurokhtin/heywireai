In addition to the Diamondbacks, Diamond Sports is responsible for the broadcast rights of the Atlanta Braves, Cincinnati Reds and Minnesota Twins, among others.\n\nReuters and other outlets requested comment from Diamond Sports on the possible bankruptcy, but the company declined to comment and the MLB declined to specify what impact the missed payment would have on the upcoming season, citing \"financial constraints\" that may be coming. The grace period on the debt agreement has already lapsed, meaning bankruptcy is likely in the near future. \n\nSources within Diamond Sports have stated that the company has greatly suffered as a result of consumer cord-cutting, as regional sports broadcasts were once seen as a prized offering in cable TV packages. \n\nWith the baseball season set to begin on March 30, news of the missed payment has raised serious questions about Diamond Sports' ability to fund the broadcast of baseball games. Sports fans in Atlanta, Cincinnati, Minnesota and Arizona will be left to wonder if their local teams will be able to be seen on their televisions. \n\nIn an effort to gain more insight into the situation, reporters have contacted and received comments after free Reuters registration from Alexia Garamfalvi and Aurora Ellis, two Reuters editors and reporters that have been working on the story. Ellis has said that she is \"cautiously optimistic\" that the teams will still be able to enjoy broadcasts of their games, despite the missed payment. \n\nIt is unclear how the bankruptcy will be handled and what potential consequences could come of it, but it is an unfortunate sign of the times as regional sports broadcasters suffer due to the decline of cable television. It remains to be seen how the bankruptcy will affect the broadcasts of MLB teams and what the future holds for the once-prized regional sports networks. \n\nBy Dietrich.Knauth@thomsonreuters.com\nPosted 2 Hours Ago"]]}
