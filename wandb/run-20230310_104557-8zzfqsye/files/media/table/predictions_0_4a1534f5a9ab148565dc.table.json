James has been in and out of the lineup this season due to various ailments, including a tendon injury in his right foot, but he's determined to get better.\n\nMeanwhile, in an interview with For The Win, Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo revealed that he only received one college offer from a U.S. school, but he chose to continue playing professionally in Greece instead of attending Old Dominion in Norfolk, Virginia. Antetokounmpo could have been a freshman in 2012-13, playing alongside Mason Plumlee, Seth Curry, and Quinn Cook, and taking Duke to the NCAA tournament.\n\nBut Antetokounmpo missed out on all of that, and now he's killing it in the NBA. The Bucks struck gold when they drafted him in 2013, and it's clear that Antetokounmpo's talents were recognized by more than just the Bucks. If he could go back in time, though, Antetokounmpo may have chosen to play alongside Zion Williamson, Jabari Parker, Jayson Tatum, and Brandon Ingram at Duke.\n\nSpeaking of Duke, Cameron Payne is still recovering from a left foot injury, which has left the Milwaukee Bucks without one of their key players. But even though Payne is out, the Bucks are looking to dominate in the NBA Finals, and maybe even bring home a championship to Milwaukee.\n\nBack in Los Angeles, LeBron James' recovery is still in progress, and he's doing everything he can to get back on the court as soon as possible. The Lakers need him, and James wants to be back out there with his teammates, leading them to victory.\n\nIn the meantime, basketball fans across the United States are keeping an eye on the playoffs, hoping that their favorite teams will come out on top. But no matter what happens, one thing is certain: the NBA always delivers on exciting games and unforgettable moments."]]}
