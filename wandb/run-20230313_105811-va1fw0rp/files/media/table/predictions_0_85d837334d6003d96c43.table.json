After the game, Davis took responsibility for the loss , and he even said his teammates did what they needed to do to help L.A.'s cause.Anthony Davis was a force. With LeBron James on the bench in street clothes and a walking boot, Davis scored a game-high 39 points in the Lakers' 113-105 victory over the Golden State Warriors at Crypto.com Arena.

With an upgraded roster, the Lakers are still struggling with fundamental problems, but Davis' performance against the Warriors was a reminder of his talent and leadership.\n\nThe Lakers' win over the Warriors highlighted Davis' versatility and adaptability on the court. He was able to score from all over the floor, both inside and outside the paint, proving to be a force that the Warriors simply couldn't contain. His incredible performance helped the Lakers secure their fourth win in their last five games.\n\nHowever, the win streak came to an end against the New York Knicks, as the Lakers lost 112-108 on Sunday. Davis struggled to make an impact in the game, scoring just 20 points on 8-of-18 shooting and missing four of his five free throws. Bayless blamed Davis for the defeat, despite the fact that the Knicks defense made it difficult for the Lakers star to establish himself in the paint.\n\nDespite the loss, Davis took responsibility for the defeat and recognized the efforts of his teammates. In fact, in the Lakers' win against the Toronto Raptors on Friday, Davis earned praise from his teammates for his selfless approach to the game. He had just eight points on seven field goal attempts and allowed Wenyen Gabriel and the second unit to pull away in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe Lakers have struggled with consistency this season, particularly in the absence of James, but Davis has been a consistent bright spot. Whether he's dominating on the offensive end or stepping up to take responsibility for losses, Davis has shown himself to be a valuable and essential component of the Lakers' success.\n\nAs the season moves forward and the race for playoff spots heats up, the Lakers will need Davis to continue his impressive play. Whether he's carrying the team through stretches without James or shifting his play to accommodate his teammates, Davis has proved himself to be an integral part of the Lakers' quest for NBA success."]]}
