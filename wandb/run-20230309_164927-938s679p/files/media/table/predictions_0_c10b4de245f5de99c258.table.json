Russell, who has been limited to contract drills with the coaches and no full team scrimmages during his ramp up to return, did not sound concerned about jumping back into action. The point guard will resume his spot in the starting backcourt, sending Dennis Schroder to the bench unit. \"I know starting is a big deal to a lot of people, but at the end of the day, finishing lineup is probably a little bit more important and Dennis will definitely be in the mix,\" Ham said of Schroder. Russell has averaged 13.5 points and 5.0 assists in four games for L.A. since being acquired from the Minnesota Timberwolves at the trade deadline. Schroder averaged 14.3 points and 8.5 assists while Russell rehabbed his ankle, helping lead the Lakers to a 4-2 record in that span, while the team was also missing LeBron James (right foot injury) for five of those games. As Russell prepares for a return, the Lakers announced Thursday that backup center Mo Bamba will be out another two weeks before being re-evaluated with a high left ankle sprain. Russell likened the upcoming stretch to a team starting the playoffs, needing to secure 16 wins to earn the title.After going through a full practice Thursday, D\u2019Angelo Russell will be available to play for the Lakers on Friday against the Toronto Raptors at Crypto.com Arena after missing the last six games with a sprained right ankle. Russell said he was \u201cgood\u201d and ready\u201d after sitting out the last two weeks to let his ankle heal. Russell was injured Feb. 23 against the Golden State Warriors in a freak accident. While taking the ball out of bounds after a Warriors basket, Russell stepped back and onto the foot of Golden State\u2019s Donte DiVincenzo. In his four games with the Lakers since being acquired from the Minnesota Timberwolves, Russell averaged 13.5 points and 5.0 assists. Ham said he and his medical staff will discuss how many minutes Russell will be able to play against the Raptors. Ham said Russell will start and that Dennis Schroder will return to his role as a spark plug off the bench. \u201cAgain, like I say, I know starting is a big deal to a lot of people, but at the end of the day, finishing lineup is probably a little bit more important and Dennis will definitely be in the mix.\u201dThe Los Angeles Lakers got some extremely rare good news on the injury front on Friday, as not only will Anthony Davis and Dennis Schr\u00f6der be able to suit up for the team's latest pivotal game against the Minnesota Timberwolves , but it sounds like D'Angelo Russell is progressing in his recovery from the right ankle sprain that will force him to miss a fourth game Ahead of Friday's tip-off vs. Russell's former team, Lakers head coach Darvin Ham said that his starting point guard was able to scrimmage with the roster's deep bench players, and that the medical staff will evaluate his response to that increased activity: On D'Lo's return, Ham said he has started on-court work, but still has a couple of steps to get through before he can play again \u2014 Cooper Halpern (@CooperHalpern) March 4, 2023 Darvin says that D'Angelo Russell, who will miss his fourth straight game tonight with a right ankle sprain, was able to play live with a \u201cstay ready\u201d group today and they'll see how he responds.\n Entities: - Calif.: U.S._state\n- Crypto.com Arena: Organization\n- Anthony Davis: Human\n- Toronto Raptors: Organization\n- Lakers: Nonprofit_organization\n- Dennis Schroder: Human\n- NBA: Business\n- D'Angelo Russell: Human\n- Dennis: Human\n- Bane: Human\n- Darvin Ham: Human\n- Memphis: Political_organisation\n- Minnesota Timberwolves: Organization\n- Toronto Raptors: Nonprofit_organization\n- Desmond: Human\n- Donte DiVincenzo: Human\n- Vanderbilt: Business\n- LeBron James: Human\n- Ham: Product_(business)\n- Lakers: Organization\n- D'Lo: Organization\n- Western Conference: Location\n- EL SEGUNDO: Location\n- Dennis Schr\u00f6der: Human\n- Advertisement\n\nRussell: Human\n- Los Angeles: Political_organisation\n- Russell: Human\n- Golden State: Nonprofit_organization\n- Minnesota Timberwolves: Nonprofit_organization\n\nBegin story:", {"prompt_tokens": 1029, "completion_tokens": 687, "total_tokens": 1716}, "\"The Return of D'Angelo Russell: Lakers Ready to Battle Raptors at Crypto.com Arena\"\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers had been struggling lately, with injuries piling up for key players like LeBron James and Anthony Davis. But they received some much-needed good news when it was announced that D'Angelo Russell would be returning to the lineup.\n\nThe team was facing off against the Toronto Raptors at the Crypto.com Arena on a Friday night, and everyone was excited to see Russell back on the court. The California native had been out for six games due to a right ankle sprain, but he was finally ready to make his return.\n\nAs the Lakers took the court for warm-ups, Russell looked focused and determined. He had been limited to contract drills during his ramp up to return, but he knew he was ready for game action.\n\nThe Lakers were in a tough battle with the Raptors, but Russell was making an impact. He had his usual smooth handles and was setting up his teammates with beautiful passes. It was clear that he had been missed during his six-game absence.\n\nDespite Russell's efforts, the game was still close in the fourth quarter. The Raptors had been hitting their shots all game and weren't letting up. That's when Dennis Schr\u00f6der stepped up.\n\nSchr\u00f6der had been moved to the bench unit when Russell returned to the starting lineup, but he was still a key player for the Lakers. He provided an energy spark every time he was on the court, and he did just that in the fourth quarter.\n\nSchr\u00f6der hit a couple of key shots to give the Lakers the lead late in the game. It was a back-and-forth battle, with both teams refusing to give an inch. But with just seconds left on the clock, Russell got his chance to shine.\n\nThe Lakers had the ball with the game tied at 98 apiece. Russell took the ball up the court, drove to the basket, and hit a beautiful floater over the outstretched arms of the Raptors' center. The ball bounced around on the rim for what felt like an eternity before dropping through the net.\n\nThe Lakers bench erupted, and the fans at the Crypto.com Arena went wild. It was a huge win for the Lakers, and Russell's return had played a major role in it. He finished the game with 20 points and 8 assists, showing that he was back to his old self after the ankle injury.\n\nAfter the game, Russell spoke to reporters about his return. \"It feels great to be back out there with my teammates,\" he said. \"I was really itching to get back on the court and help this team win. It was tough watching from the sidelines, but I'm glad I was able to come back and make an impact.\"\n\nThe Lakers were still facing an uphill battle in the tough Western Conference, but with Russell back in the fold, they were feeling more confident. They knew that they had a talented team and that they could compete with anyone in the NBA.\n\nAs the team headed back to their base in El Segundo, they were already looking ahead to their next game. They knew that they had to stay focused and continue to fight, but with Russell back in the lineup, they felt like anything was possible. The Lakers were ready to take on anyone who stood in their way, and they were looking to make a deep run in the playoffs."]]}
