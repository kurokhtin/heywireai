March 13 (Reuters) - SVB Financial Group (SIVB.O) and two top executives were sued on Monday by shareholders who accused them of concealing how rising interest rates would leave its Silicon Valley Bank unit, which failed last week, \"particularly susceptible\" to a bank run. It appeared to be the first of many likely lawsuits over the demise of Silicon Valley Bank, which U.S. regulators seized on March 10 following a surge of deposit withdrawals. SVB had surprised the market two days earlier by disclosing a $1.8 billion after-tax loss from investment sales and that it planned to raise capital, as it scrambled to meet redemption requests. Its collapse has sparked fears of contagion among other lenders that also cater to wealthy clients, including technology start-ups and venture capital-backed companies, as well as large regional banks. In Monday's lawsuit, shareholders led by Chandra Vanipenta said Santa Clara, California-based SVB failed to disclose how rising interest rates would undermine its business model, and leave it worse off than banks with different client bases. The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages for SVB investors between June 16, 2021 and March 10, 2023. SVB said on Monday it will explore strategic alternatives for what remains of the company, now shorn of its main banking business.(Adds background about bank's collapse, contagion fears, shareholder claims, case citation) March 13 (Reuters) - SVB Financial Group and two top executives were sued on Monday by shareholders who accused them of concealing how rising interest rates would leave its Silicon Valley Bank unit, which failed last week, \"particularly susceptible\" to a bank run.

It also alleged that SVB was more vulnerable to risks like a bank run than other organizations in the financial sector.\n\nThe news of SVB\u2019s collapse caused a wave of fear among other industry players that cater to high-net-worth clients, venture capital-backed companies, and regional banks. The lawsuit claims shareholders sustained damages resulting from the company\u2019s failure to disclose relevant information between June 16th 2021 and March 10th 2023.\n\nThe suit also names CEO Greg Becker and CFO Daniel Beck, who are accused of deliberately overlooking the potential threat of rising interest rates to the bank.\n\nIn a statement responding to the allegations, SVB said it was \u201ccould not have foreseen the events of March 10th,\u201d and that it plans to \u201cexplore strategic alternatives\u201d for what remains of the organization. The company added that it was not at fault for the failure of its main banking business, which US regulators had imposed on the company following a surge of deposit withdrawals.\n\nThe statement referred to the company\u2019s surprise disclosure of a $1.8 billion after-tax loss from investment sales and its intention to raise capital to meet redemption requests.\n\nThe lawsuit against SVB is just one of several potential legal claims against the organization, as it continues to face the fallout of the Silicon Valley Bank collapse. The sudden increase in interest rates, which many saw as having a detrimental impact on some financial institutions, has heightened concerns that the situation could have wide-reaching effects across the industry.\n\nIn the meantime, the lawsuit is seeking unspecified damages for SVB\u2019s shareholders, who are being represented by New York lawyer Jonathan Stempel. The lawsuit comes as investors, regulators, and industry insiders alike grapple with the implications of SVB\u2019s collapse.\n\nThe matter is Chandra Vanipenta et al v SVB Financial Group et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 21-cv-02591.\n\nTitle: Shareholders Sue SVB Financial Group Over Silicon Valley Bank Collapse"]]}
