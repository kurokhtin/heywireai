Joe Reedy of the Associated Press remembered when Leonard had led the Toronto Raptors to the 2019 NBA title. Joe had hopes that Leonard would be able to recreate the same level of success with the Los Angeles Clippers. \n\nThe 2021-2022 season had been difficult, he had managed to achieve success, scoring an average of 24 points per game; still, nothing was the same. On March 8, 2023 the Los Angeles Clippers had travelled to Toronto, to take on Leonard's former team, Jesse had a feeling that this game could change everything. \n\nThe game began and Russell Westbrook immediately went all out to try and prove himself, managing to turn up the heat. He was joined by Paul George and his infectious energy, and the support of Terrance Mann and Ivica Zubac. Scottie Barnes and Pascal Siakam tried their best to keep the game close for the Toronto Raptors but it was Leonard who stole the show. \n\nIn the first half, Leonard had been impressive, but it was in the fourth quarter when he truly showed what he was capable of. Slamming a thunderous dunk over Jakob Poeltl and bringing the score to 100-85 with 5 minutes left in the game. The Raptors, however, were not ready to give up so easily and had a 15-4 surge to close the score deficit to 4 points, before Zubac arrived to push it back to six. The Clippers would eventually win the game, leaving a feeling of hope in everyone's hearts. \n\n\nThe game had been more than just a numbers win for the Clippers, Leonard had arrived. His success had been seen and felt, a superstar was reborn and the Los Angeles Clippers had seen him. The Associated Press wrote an article on the game titled, \u201cA Re-Emerging Giant: The Return of Kawhi Leonard\u201d which was picked up by NEXT, the Lancaster County Local Journalism Fund, and other local platforms. \n\nAt the end of the season, the Clippers managed to qualify for the playoffs due to their success, and Leonard was named MVP. UP and Los Angeles spoke of the successes that the Clippers had managed to achieve. Giving success to all the stock exchanges, stock market indexes such as TIP and all the funds in the city. \n\nThe 2021-2022 season had been difficult, but the teammates of Leonard, with their undying support, had pushed the Clippers to success. G Will Barton, who had been unfortunate enough to be the 16th overall pic in 2016 was able to develop and maximize the use of his skills and a near maximum in his free agency contract. \n\nThe Los Angeles Clippers made it to the fifth round of the playoffs, managing to take the Los Angeles Lakers to sixth games before eventually losing out. However, the season was a success and made NEXT, the Lancaster County Local Journalism Fund and all other platforms in New York and Los Angeles proud. The AP also wrote an article titled, \u201cThe Success of the Los Angeles Clippers\u201d that was picked up by the NBA\u2019s official site. \n\nThe 2023-2024 season brings with it a new season of hope and glory, with Kawhi Leonard leading the Los Angeles Clippers, the city has high hopes of reclaiming the title he won in 2019 with the Toronto Raptors. \n\nThe story of Kawhi Leonard is a classic example of success in the midst of tough challenges. The same challenges have now been thrown to the Clippers and Leonard, with the city of Los Angeles putting their hopes on him to lead the team to success. The success of our team depends on Leonard, and the city is ready. \n\nFor Leonard, it is time to re-emerge as a giant and use the challenges of the game to prove himself once again. \n \nThe story of Kawhi Leonard and his re-emergence as a giant will inspire athletes everywhere to push past their challenges, and not let their dreams die. This is a story for the ages."]]}
