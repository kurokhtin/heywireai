Russell, who has been limited to contract drills with the coaches and no full team scrimmages during his ramp up to return, did not sound concerned about jumping back into action. The point guard will resume his spot in the starting backcourt, sending Dennis Schroder to the bench unit. \"I know starting is a big deal to a lot of people, but at the end of the day, finishing lineup is probably a little bit more important and Dennis will definitely be in the mix,\" Ham said of Schroder. Russell has averaged 13.5 points and 5.0 assists in four games for L.A. since being acquired from the Minnesota Timberwolves at the trade deadline. Schroder averaged 14.3 points and 8.5 assists while Russell rehabbed his ankle, helping lead the Lakers to a 4-2 record in that span, while the team was also missing LeBron James (right foot injury) for five of those games. As Russell prepares for a return, the Lakers announced Thursday that backup center Mo Bamba will be out another two weeks before being re-evaluated with a high left ankle sprain. Russell likened the upcoming stretch to a team starting the playoffs, needing to secure 16 wins to earn the title.After going through a full practice Thursday, D\u2019Angelo Russell will be available to play for the Lakers on Friday against the Toronto Raptors at Crypto.com Arena after missing the last six games with a sprained right ankle. Russell said he was \u201cgood\u201d and ready\u201d after sitting out the last two weeks to let his ankle heal. Russell was injured Feb. 23 against the Golden State Warriors in a freak accident. While taking the ball out of bounds after a Warriors basket, Russell stepped back and onto the foot of Golden State\u2019s Donte DiVincenzo. In his four games with the Lakers since being acquired from the Minnesota Timberwolves, Russell averaged 13.5 points and 5.0 assists. Ham said he and his medical staff will discuss how many minutes Russell will be able to play against the Raptors. Ham said Russell will start and that Dennis Schroder will return to his role as a spark plug off the bench. \u201cAgain, like I say, I know starting is a big deal to a lot of people, but at the end of the day, finishing lineup is probably a little bit more important and Dennis will definitely be in the mix.\u201dThe Los Angeles Lakers got some extremely rare good news on the injury front on Friday, as not only will Anthony Davis and Dennis Schr\u00f6der be able to suit up for the team's latest pivotal game against the Minnesota Timberwolves , but it sounds like D'Angelo Russell is progressing in his recovery from the right ankle sprain that will force him to miss a fourth game Ahead of Friday's tip-off vs. Russell's former team, Lakers head coach Darvin Ham said that his starting point guard was able to scrimmage with the roster's deep bench players, and that the medical staff will evaluate his response to that increased activity: On D'Lo's return, Ham said he has started on-court work, but still has a couple of steps to get through before he can play again \u2014 Cooper Halpern (@CooperHalpern) March 4, 2023 Darvin says that D'Angelo Russell, who will miss his fourth straight game tonight with a right ankle sprain, was able to play live with a \u201cstay ready\u201d group today and they'll see how he responds.\n Entities: - Calif.: U.S._state\n- Crypto.com Arena: Organization\n- Anthony Davis: Human\n- Toronto Raptors: Organization\n- Lakers: Nonprofit_organization\n- Dennis Schroder: Human\n- NBA: Business\n- D'Angelo Russell: Human\n- Dennis: Human\n- Bane: Human\n- Darvin Ham: Human\n- Memphis: Political_organisation\n- Minnesota Timberwolves: Organization\n- Toronto Raptors: Nonprofit_organization\n- Desmond: Human\n- Donte DiVincenzo: Human\n- Vanderbilt: Business\n- LeBron James: Human\n- Ham: Product_(business)\n- Lakers: Organization\n- D'Lo: Organization\n- Western Conference: Location\n- EL SEGUNDO: Location\n- Dennis Schr\u00f6der: Human\n- Advertisement\n\nRussell: Human\n- Los Angeles: Political_organisation\n- Russell: Human\n- Golden State: Nonprofit_organization\n- Minnesota Timberwolves: Nonprofit_organization\n\nBegin story:", {"prompt_tokens": 1029, "completion_tokens": 573, "total_tokens": 1602}, "\"The Return of Russell: Lakers Get Good News on Injury Front\"\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers were on the edge of their seats as they awaited news on the return of star point guard D'Angelo Russell. After missing six games due to a right ankle sprain, the Lakers were eager to have their starting guard back on the court once again.\n\nCoach Darvin Ham said that Russell had been limited to contract drills during his rehab but had not expressed any concerns about returning to action. The Lakers had won four out of six games without their star point guard, thanks in part to the efforts of backup guard Dennis Schroder, who had stepped up in Russell's absence.\n\nBut with Russell's return, the Lakers were eager to have their starting backcourt duo playing together once again. Russell, who had averaged 13.5 points and 5.0 assists in four games for L.A. since being acquired from the Minnesota Timberwolves at the trade deadline, was excited to get back on the court for the Lakers.\n\nAfter undergoing a full practice on Thursday, Russell was cleared to play in the Lakers' game against the Toronto Raptors at Crypto.com Arena on Friday.

They were confident that his return would give them the boost they needed to make a run in the Western Conference.\n\nWith Russell leading the charge, the Lakers surged ahead in the first quarter, taking an early lead against their opponents. Anthony Davis and Dennis Schroder also made key contributions, scoring points and playing strong defense to keep the Raptors at bay.\n\nAs the game wore on, the Lakers continued to dominate, with Russell scoring key points and setting up his teammates for easy baskets. The Raptors tried to mount a comeback, but the Lakers' defense was too strong, and they held on for a decisive victory.\n\nAfter the game, Russell was pleased with his performance and expressed gratitude for the support of his teammates and the Lakers organization. \"It feels great to be back on the court and contributing to my team's success,\" he said. \"I couldn't have done it without the support of my teammates and the Lakers organization. We still have a long way to go, but I'm excited for what's ahead.\"\n\nWith Russell back in the lineup, the Lakers were once again a formidable force in the Western Conference. As they continued to battle for a playoff spot, they knew that the return of their star point guard would only make them stronger.\n\nAs they left the court that night, the Lakers knew that they had what it took to compete with the best teams in the league. And with Russell leading the way, they were ready to take on anyone who stood in their way."]]}
