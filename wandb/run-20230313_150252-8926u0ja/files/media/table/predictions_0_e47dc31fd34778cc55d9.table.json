Ten more people were indicted Monday for misappropriating and laundering money they got through a federal child nutrition program prosecutors say was bilked out of more than $250 million, primarily in Minnesota. U.S. Attorney Andy Luger said the money was spent on fancy cars from Teslas to BMWs to luxe resort vacations, and even a deposit on an airplane. Just like the first 50 people indicted, the defendants are charged with falsely claiming to have fed thousands of needy children daily, generating fake invoices to make it appear they were buying large amounts of food, but spending much of the money on themselves. Among those charged is a prominent woman in the Bloomington area, Ayan Farah Abukar, 41, who was lauded as an \u201coutstanding refugee\u201d in 2021 by the state Department of Human Services, the Reformer reported in October. Abukar founded Action for East African People, which she enrolled in the federal child nutrition program under the sponsorship of Feeding Our Future and another unnamed company. She\u2019s charged with falsely claiming to serve up to 5,000 children a day at sites in Bloomington, Minneapolis, Savage, and St. Paul from October 2020 through 2022. Luger said among the most brazen schemes he\u2019s seen is that of Kawsar Jama, 41, of Eagan, who claimed to be feeding 2,560 meals per day to needy children in Pelican Rapids, which has a total population of about 2,500./Minnesota Reformer Ten more people were indicted Monday for misappropriating and laundering money they got through a federal child nutrition program prosecutors say was bilked out of more than $250 million in Minnesota.

Of those ten, one was particularly notable - Ayan Farah Abukar, 41, of Bloomington. Abukar had been commended only the year before by the state Department of Human Services for her numerous contributions as an \u201coutstanding refugee\". \n\nNow, however, she was accused of submitting up to $3.7 million in fraudulent claims to various sites in Bloomington, Minneapolis, Savage, and St. Paul. Abukar started Action for East African People and allegedly used it to take part in the federal nutrition program under the sponsorship of Feeding Our Future and an unnamed company. \n\nKawsar Jama, 41, of Eagan and owner of Lido Restaurant, was another of the defendants. Jama had claimed to be able to feed up to 2,560 meals a day to needy children in Pelican Rapids, a city with a population of about 2,500. He was accused of bringing in about $5.7 million in fraudulently obtained funds and using some of that money to make mortgage payments and cash withdrawals and buy vehicles, including a Freightliner Cascadia truck.\n\nAnother defendant, Hussein Awale of Faribault, allegedly received up to $3 million in federal funds that he used to make payments to a Feeding Our Future employee and purchase cars with. He was also found to have claimed to provide up to 2,500 daily meals at his East African restaurant located in the Midtown Global Market, a thriving market in Minneapolis. \n\nThe most senior of the defendants this time around, however, was Sharon Denise Ross, 52, of Big Lake. Ross was the executive director of House of Refuge Twin Cities, a non-profit which she enrolled in the federal program under the sponsorship of Feeding Our Future and an unnamed company. She was accused of claiming to have served thousands of children daily, fraudulently receiving $2.8 million which she used to purchase real estate, vehicles, and payments to family members.\n\nLuger concluded his press conference by saying that this was one of the largest frauds he had ever seen, with over $250 million stolen. He reminded the media that this most recent round of indictments adds to a roster of over 50 defendants and urged them to think not only of the fraud, but of all the children who went unfed due to this criminal enterprise. \n\nTitle: Ten More People Indicted for Misuse of Federal Child Nutrition Funds in Minnesota"]]}
