In a statement released last month, the broadcaster admitted to missing a $140 million payment owed to its lenders, triggering a 30-day grace period on its debt agreements.\n\nSources familiar with the negotiations, who asked to remain anonymous to speak frankly, now expect the talks to lead to a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing from Diamond Sports next week.\n\nThe missed payment amounts to $31 million, according to a source familiar with the matter. The company owns the rights to local broadcasts for the Arizona Diamondbacks, Atlanta Braves, Cincinnati Reds, and Minnesota Twins - a significant chunk of the payroll for each of these professional teams.\n\nDiamond Sport has responded to Reuters' request for comment on the possible bankruptcy, saying that its financial constraints should not impact its broadcasts for the upcoming MLB season, which opens with a much-anticipated matchup between the Cubs and the White Sox on March 30. \n\nRegional sports broadcasts were once seen as a prized offering in cable TV packages. However, the changing media landscape - with consumer cord-cutting becoming ever-more prevalent - has made this business model less sustainable.\n\nRegister for free at Reuters to learn more information about this rapidly-unfolding situation.
