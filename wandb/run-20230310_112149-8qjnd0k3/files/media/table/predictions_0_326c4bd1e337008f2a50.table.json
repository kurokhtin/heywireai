The cartel apologized for the violence, turned over members involved, and condemned the actions in a letter obtained by The Associated Press. On Friday, March 3, four Americans crossed the border into Matamoros, Mexico, and were abducted. Two were later found dead, and the Gulf Cartel is believed to have acted against them after they thought the Americans were reaching into their illegal activities, according to a Mexican official's internal document seen by Reuters. Mexican law enforcement is continuing to investigate the possible motive for the kidnappings, though \"drug trafficking\" was not explicitly confirmed as a factor, that has been ruled out. The bodies of two of the Americans were found in a wood cabin southeast of Matamoros, and two others survived the ordeal, with one being shot in the leg. Brownsville residents, Eric James and LaTavia Washington McGee were kidnapped and rescued, after they were held captive with two others. Shaheed Woodard and Zindell Brown were kidnapped and later found dead; Arely Servando was caught in cartel gunfire and died from a stray bullet. McGee and James were rescued from a cartel stash house in a rural town, El Tecolote. Tamaulipas Governor Am\u00e9rico Villarreal confirmed the condition of four kidnapped Americans over the phone during President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador's news conference on Tuesday, as the FBI and Mexican officials continue to collaborate on the investigation."]]}
