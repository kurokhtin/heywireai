Pierce, who retired in 2017, is currently camped out in his Los Angeles home frequently watching NBA games with piles of chicken wings and hosting friends for marquee matchups. Pierce's love for basketball will take him to Houston next week for the first round of the NCAA tournament, where he'll watch from inside a Buffalo Wild Wings with \u201cAll The Smoke\u201d podcast hosts Stephen Jackson and Matt Barnes, plus two-time WNBA MVP A'Ja Wilson as part of an activation experience labeled \u201cBnB-Dubs.\u201d Pierce has embraced every opportunity to remain involved with the sport, such as  working with Showtime Basketball after concluding his run with ESPN. \n\nWhile watching the NCAA tournament games, Pierce is also keeping an eye on the upcoming NBA Draft, and has taken a liking to a certain Frenchman. \"I'm hearing a lot of things about (Victor) Wembanyama. He's looking like he could be the No. 1 pick, you know what I'm saying?\" he said during a recent interview with NBC Sports Boston. \"A 7'2 kid that can do everything on the floor, that's a stretch five. And then you think about some of the top five guys, and I think Jaylen's gonna be right up there, (Kevin) Durant's gonna be there...but who knows who's gonna end up with that No. 1 pick.\"\n\nWhile Pierce has been successful in making a seamless transition from playing to retirement by keeping a close involvement with basketball, Syracuse's basketball coach Jim Boeheim may not have such a smooth experience. Boeheim was relieved of his head coaching duties shortly after his team\u2019s loss to Wake Forest in the ACC Tournament, leaving the fate of the program in the air. Boeheim gave vague answers to questions about his future leading the program, and University officials replaced him with Adrian Autry. \n\nDespite the uncertainty surrounding Boeheim and the Syracuse basketball program, 20-year-old actress Jenna Ortega is securing a deal to star in director Tim Burton's upcoming \u201cBeetlejuice 2.\u201d Ortega rose to stardom on the hit Netflix series \u201cWednesday,\u201d which was produced by Burton. The director has kept busy recently, reportedly in discussions to direct a new live-action series based on the \"Addams Family.\" \n\nReturning to basketball, Fox News reports that Brooklyn Net's star Kevin Durant is set to miss time with a hamstring injury, just before the NBA All-Star game. Durant is expected to miss two games with the injury, as the Nets continue to juggle injuries and play for a championship. Meanwhile, with the Suns currently on an 8-game winning streak, it remains to be seen whether they can maintain their current success and make a deep playoff run. \n\nIn other news, a recent report indicates that Inland California, Illinois, New Jersey, and Delaware have the highest concentrations of the most-at-risk markets in the country in regards to the COVID-19 pandemic, with the biggest clusters in the New York City and Chicago metropolitan areas. The U.S. continues to experience a high rate of COVID-19 cases and deaths, with many areas facing new waves of infections. \n\nAs Pierce soaked in the NCAA tournament games with a fresh batch of Buffalo Wild Wings, he reminisced about his draft night ten years ago when he was traded to Brooklyn. He also kept a close eye on the on-court performances of up-and-coming players, hoping to see the next big stars emerge. While the pandemic has caused many challenges for the sport and its fans, Pierce's love for basketball remains strong, and he continues to find ways to stay involved."]]}
