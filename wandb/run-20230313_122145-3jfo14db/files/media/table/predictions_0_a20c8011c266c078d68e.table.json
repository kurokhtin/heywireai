March 13 (Reuters) - SVB Financial Group (SIVB.O) and two top executives were sued on Monday by shareholders who accused them of concealing how rising interest rates would leave its Silicon Valley Bank unit, which failed last week, \"particularly susceptible\" to a bank run. It appeared to be the first of many likely lawsuits over the demise of Silicon Valley Bank, which U.S. regulators seized on March 10 following a surge of deposit withdrawals. SVB had surprised the market two days earlier by disclosing a $1.8 billion after-tax loss from investment sales and that it planned to raise capital, as it scrambled to meet redemption requests. Its collapse has sparked fears of contagion among other lenders that also cater to wealthy clients, including technology start-ups and venture capital-backed companies, as well as large regional banks. In Monday's lawsuit, shareholders led by Chandra Vanipenta said Santa Clara, California-based SVB failed to disclose how rising interest rates would undermine its business model, and leave it worse off than banks with different client bases. The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages for SVB investors between June 16, 2021 and March 10, 2023. SVB said on Monday it will explore strategic alternatives for what remains of the company, now shorn of its main banking business.It appeared to be the first of many likely lawsuits over the demise of Silicon Valley Bank, which U.S. regulators seized on March 10 following a surge of deposit withdrawals.

The lawsuit was filed in the federal court in San Jose, California in what is expected to be the first of many over the demise of Silicon Valley Bank last week, following a surge of deposit withdrawals.\n \nThe class action, led by Chandra Vanipenta, accuses SVB, as well as Chief Executive Greg Becker, and Chief Financial Officer Daniel Beck, of not alerting investors to how the rising interest rates and their business model would ultimately cause a bank run, leaving their bank exposed and worse off than those with different clientele. The plaintiff seeks damages for SVB investors between June 16, 2021 and the collapse, March 10, 2023.\n \nThe $1.8 billion after-tax loss from investments sales and the scramble to meet redemption requests on March 8, had brought about the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, sending ripples of fear and concern through the banking community.\n\nSilicon Valley Bank had an estimated $209 billion of assets and $175.4 billion of deposits before it went under, making it the largest U.S. bank failure since the 2008 financial crisis. Banks who catered to wealthy clients, technology start-ups, venture capital-backed companies, and large regional banks felt an increased sense of urgency and the possibility of contagion due to the collapse.\n\nIn a statement released Monday, SVB said they were exploring strategic alternatives for what remained of the company, now shorn of its main banking business. Editing was done in a variety of locations, including New York by Sandra Maler and in California by Reuters.\n\nThe U.S. regulators seized the bank on March 10, following the realization of the deposit withdrawals. Nathan Frandino, a photographer for the Reuters news agency had been there earlier that day, taking pictures of the headquarters in Santa Clara. The district court in Santa Clara and the Northern District court in California are both closely monitoring the situation and have become involved in any legal proceedings that may arise from it.\n\nThe class action was launched with the knowledge of The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles, a set of standards set forth by the company. Further reporting was done by Jonathan Stempel in New York. Silicon Valley Bank has not yet had a chance to respond to the lawsuit, but their plans to move forward with what is left of the company are already underway.\n \nThe future of SVB Financial Group appears to be uncertain at this moment, and it remains to be seen what consequences their negligence to adequately inform investors of their impending collapse will have.\n\nIt is likely that in the coming weeks, more lawsuits will be filed against SVB Financial Group, as more information about the company's negligence is revealed."]]}
