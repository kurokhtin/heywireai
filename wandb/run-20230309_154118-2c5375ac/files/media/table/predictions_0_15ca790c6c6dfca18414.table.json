Russell, who has been limited to contract drills with the coaches and no full team scrimmages during his ramp up to return, did not sound concerned about jumping back into action. The point guard will resume his spot in the starting backcourt, sending Dennis Schroder to the bench unit. \"I know starting is a big deal to a lot of people, but at the end of the day, finishing lineup is probably a little bit more important and Dennis will definitely be in the mix,\" Ham said of Schroder. Russell has averaged 13.5 points and 5.0 assists in four games for L.A. since being acquired from the Minnesota Timberwolves at the trade deadline. Schroder averaged 14.3 points and 8.5 assists while Russell rehabbed his ankle, helping lead the Lakers to a 4-2 record in that span, while the team was also missing LeBron James (right foot injury) for five of those games. As Russell prepares for a return, the Lakers announced Thursday that backup center Mo Bamba will be out another two weeks before being re-evaluated with a high left ankle sprain. Russell likened the upcoming stretch to a team starting the playoffs, needing to secure 16 wins to earn the title.The Los Angeles Lakers got some extremely rare good news on the injury front on Friday, as not only will Anthony Davis and Dennis Schr\u00f6der be able to suit up for the team's latest pivotal game against the Minnesota Timberwolves , but it sounds like D'Angelo Russell is progressing in his recovery from the right ankle sprain that will force him to miss a fourth game Ahead of Friday's tip-off vs. Russell's former team, Lakers head coach Darvin Ham said that his starting point guard was able to scrimmage with the roster's deep bench players, and that the medical staff will evaluate his response to that increased activity: On D'Lo's return, Ham said he has started on-court work, but still has a couple of steps to get through before he can play again \u2014 Cooper Halpern (@CooperHalpern) March 4, 2023 Darvin says that D'Angelo Russell, who will miss his fourth straight game tonight with a right ankle sprain, was able to play live with a \u201cstay ready\u201d group today and they'll see how he responds.Austin Reaves sat at the podium postgame, his eyes eventually dropping toward the table to look at the stat sheet, a look of amazement when he saw how long Troy Brown Jr. had played for the Lakers during their win over the Golden State Warriors on Sunday afternoon. He displayed his all-around game during that time, scoring 14 points on five-for-10 shooting, four for seven on three-pointers, grabbing eight rebounds and handing out two assists. He did his part on defense, too, defending Klay Thompson at times, Stephen Curry when caught in a switch, Draymond Green, or any other player the Lakers asked him to guard. Brown had gone to the bench when Lakers coach Darvin Ham decided to start recently acquired Jarred Vanderbilt alongside Anthony Davis and James. The job he did on Klay, when he got cross-matched on different guys, he earned his weight in gold tonight. It was Brown who scored on a layup by cutting to the basket, taking the pass from Davis for a two-point lead late in the fourth quarter that the Lakers never let get away. So, for me, I just try to come out every night and do what I can do and make sure I\u2019m locked in and give the team what I need on my end.\u201d Not only that, Schroder has to play his typical tough defense against some of the best point guards in the NBA.\n Entities: - Ham: Organization\n- Draymond Green: Human\n- Reaves: Human\n- Vanderbilt: Business\n- 33:16: Organization\n- Jordan Poole: Human\n- D'Angelo Russell: Human\n- Anthony Davis: Human\n- Minnesota: State_(polity)\n- Toronto Raptors: Organization\n- Golden State Warriors: Organization\n- Vanderbilt: Company\n- Klay Thompson: Human\n- So: Human\n- Darvin Ham: Human\n- LeBron James: Human\n- Austin Reaves: Human\n- NBA: Business\n- NBA: Organization\n- Lakers: Organization\n- Troy Brown Jr.: Human\n- D'Lo: Organization\n- Dennis Schroder: Human\n- EL SEGUNDO: Location\n- James: Human\n- Jeez: Human\n- Dennis: Human\n- Los Angeles: Political_organisation\n- Western Conference: Location\n- Oklahoma City Thunder: Organization\n- Ham: Product_(business)\n- Dennis Schr\u00f6der: Human\n- Stephen Curry: Human\n- Russell: Human\n- Memphis: Political_organisation\n- Minnesota Timberwolves: Organization\n- Bane: Human\n- OKC: Organization\n- Calif.: U.S._state\n- Desmond: Human\n- Brown: Educational_organization\n- Davis: Local_government\n- AR: Country\n\nBegin story:", {"prompt_tokens": 1152, "completion_tokens": 625, "total_tokens": 1777}, "\"The Rise of Troy Brown Jr.: A Lakers' Cinderella Story\"\n\nTroy Brown Jr. was just another player on the roster for the Los Angeles Lakers. He was known for his hard work and dedication on the court, but he was often overlooked in favor of bigger names like LeBron James and Anthony Davis. However, when injuries hit the team hard and they were forced to make some changes, Brown stepped up to the challenge.\n\nIt all started when D'Angelo Russell went down with a right ankle sprain, forcing him to miss several games. Dennis Schroder stepped up to take his place in the starting lineup, but Laker's coach Darvin Ham also knew he needed someone to fill Schroder's spot on the bench. That's when Brown was given an opportunity.\n\nAt first, Brown was nervous. He had never played significant minutes in an NBA game before, let alone in the Western Conference. But Ham had faith in him, and he slowly started to gain confidence. The more he played, the better he got. Soon, he was playing 33 minutes a game and putting up impressive numbers, including a game-winning layup against the Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\nBrown wasn't the only one surprised by his success. Austin Reaves, one of Brown's teammates, was amazed at how well he played. \"It was like he'd been doing this his whole life,\" he said in an interview after the game.\n\nAs the season progressed, Brown continued to excel. He played tough defense against some of the best players in the league, including Draymond Green and Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors. He also became a reliable scoring option for the Lakers, averaging 14 points a game.\n\nDespite his success, Brown remained humble. \"I'm just trying to come out every night and do what I can do,\" he said in a postgame interview. \"Make sure I'm locked in and give the team what I need on my end.\"\n\nHis hard work and dedication paid off when he was named Western Conference Player of the Month for March, beating out big names like LeBron James and Russell Westbrook. It was a moment he would never forget.\n\nBut the road to success wasn't always easy for Brown. He had to overcome doubts and setbacks along the way. He was a late first-round pick in the NBA Draft, and many experts didn't think he would make it in the league. He was even traded twice in his first two seasons, first from the Memphis Grizzlies to the Minnesota Timberwolves, and then to the Lakers.\n\nBut Brown never gave up. He kept working hard, even when no one was watching. And now he's become an integral part of the Lakers' success.\n\nAs the regular season comes to a close and the playoffs loom, Brown knows the stakes are higher than ever. But he's ready for the challenge. \"It's like starting the playoffs,\" he said. \"We've got to secure 16 wins to earn the title.\"\n\nAnd if his recent success is any indication, Brown is more than capable of helping the Lakers do just that."]]}
