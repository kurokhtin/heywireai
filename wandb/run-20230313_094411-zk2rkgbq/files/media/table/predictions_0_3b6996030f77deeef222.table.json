He scored just eight points in L.A.'s win over the Toronto Raptors on Friday, and although he was better versus the Knicks, he still didn't do enough. He shot 8-of-18 and missed four of his five free throws, which was a significant factor in his team's defeat and caused Bayless to blame him for the Lakers' inability to get the job done.

The Knicks fronted him, swarmed him with defenders and didn't allow him to become entrenched in the paint like he normally does. After the game, Davis took responsibility for the loss , and he even said his teammates did what they needed to do to help L.A.'s cause.Anthony Davis was a force. With LeBron James on the bench in street clothes and a walking boot, Davis scored a game-high 39 points in the Lakers' 113-105 victory over the Golden State Warriors at Crypto.com Arena. The Lakers might have upgraded their roster last month, Davis might be carrying them in James' absence and the Western Conference might be wide open, but the team's fundamental problem remains the same.

Despite scoring a game-high 39 points in the Lakers' victory over the Golden State Warriors, Davis failed to take over the game against the Knicks and missed four of his five free throws. However, it may not be entirely fair to blame Davis for the loss as the Knicks defense swarmed him with defenders, making it difficult for him to score. \n\nOn the other hand, Bayless also had some harsh words for Dallas Mavericks' Luka Don\u010di\u0107, who he called \"almost unwatchable\" after the team's 130-126 loss against the Phoenix Suns. Bayless took issue with Don\u010di\u0107 constantly complaining to the referees during the game and also sided with Suns guard Devin Booker in their ongoing feud. \n\nBut despite the criticisms, Davis has shouldered the blame for the Lakers' loss and recognized that he didn't do his job well enough. The Lakers will need him to step up his game if they hope to stay competitive in the Western Conference, especially with LeBron James currently out due to injury. \n\nAlthough the Lakers have struggled in their recent games, there is still hope for the team. In their win against the Toronto Raptors, Davis showed a selfless approach and allowed the team's second unit to take over in the fourth quarter. And in recent victories over the Grizzlies and Warriors, he has shown Shaquille O'Neal-level performances and kept his foot on the gas in the clutch. \n\nWith the NBA season in full swing, fans can stay up to date with the latest viral graphics, memes, rumors, and trending news by subscribing to the Clutch Newsletter.
