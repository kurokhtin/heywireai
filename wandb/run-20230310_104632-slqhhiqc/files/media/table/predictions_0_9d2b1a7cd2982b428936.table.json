Everyone in Orland Park was buzzing about the opening of the iconic Fatburger chain and its sister business, Buffalo Express, in their community. The partnership between NBA stars and two Black female entrepreneurs had everyone excited.\n\nOn opening day, the line wrapped around the block as people eagerly waited to get their hands on the famous burgers. The players were there to greet customers and take pictures with fans. Everyone was having a great time, except for one person - the COO of FAT Brands Inc.\n\nHe had been looking forward to this day for months, but when he arrived, he noticed something strange. The logo for Buffalo Express was spelled wrong. Instead of \"Buffalo's Express,\" it simply said \"Buffalo Express.\" He was mortified. How had this happened? He quickly pulled out his phone and texted the marketing team, demanding an explanation.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the restaurant, things were going smoothly. Customers were raving about the delicious burgers and wings, and the staff was working hard to keep up with the demand. Toi Salter and Jackie Jackson were beaming with pride.\n\n\u201cThis opening is just the start of our growth in the state, and it is particularly meaningful to have on-board such an experienced partner to lead our expansion,\" Toi Salter said with a smile.\n\nDerrick Rose overheard her and chimed in, \"And we're thrilled to be here and serve the people of Illinois. This is a dream come true for us.\"\n\nThe grand opening celebration was a huge success. The first 100 customers received a free Original Fatburger, and everyone walked away feeling satisfied and happy. Even the COO of FAT Brands Inc. eventually let go of his frustration and enjoyed a yummy burger with the rest of the crowd.\n\nAs the night wore on, people started to trickle out of the restaurant, but not before thanking the owners and congratulating them on their success. It was a great day for Orland Park and for the partnership between the NBA stars and the two women entrepreneurs.\n\nThe next day, the marketing team had an explanation for the misspelling on the Buffalo Express logo. It turns out, it was just a printing error, and the team had already started working on fixing it. The COO breathed a sigh of relief.\n\nIn the end, everyone was happy. Orland Park had a new favorite burger joint, the NBA stars had invested in a successful business, and the two women entrepreneurs had fulfilled a lifelong dream. It was a win-win for everyone involved.\n\nAnd as for the misspelled logo? Well, it just added a little extra comedic relief to an already funny story."]]}
