       "   'content': 'The NBA’s all-time leader in triple-doubles will not suit up for the Utah Jazz. Traded to Utah as part of the three-team deal between the Jazz, Los Angeles Lakers and Minnesota Timberwolves, Russell Westbrook will reportedly sign with the Los Angeles Clippers after the Utah Jazz bought out his contract, Westbrook’s agent Jeff Schwartz told ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski. The Utah Jazz officially announced that the team had waived Westbrook on Monday afternoon. Wojnarowski reported that Westbrook was told by Jazz general manager Danny Ainge and others that they would “welcome him reporting to the team,” but are “prioritizing and playing its younger players and they would make no assurances on minutes or role size.” Utah, which traded veteran point guard Mike Conley to the Timberwolves as part of the deal, has been staring fifth-year guard Collin Sexton at point guard since the trade, and has been giving rookie guard Ochai Agbaji more minutes. Westbrook will join former Oklahoma City Thunder teammate Paul George with the Clippers.',\n",

The deal will reportedly be finalized Tuesday and will lock up Beverley for the rest of the season.Beverley, an 11-year NBA veteran, was born in Chicago in 1988. He played his high school basketball at John Marshall High School, which has produced eight NBA players. Shams Charnia of The Athletic also reported the move.\\xa0In 45 games with the Lakers this season, Beverley averaged 6.4 points, 3.1 rebounds, and 2.6 assists per game. On Feb. 9, Los Angeles traded him to the Magic as part of the massive four-team deal that landed the Lakers center Mo Bamba. It marked the third trade involving Beverley in the span of a little over seven months, and Orlando quickly waived him.Earlier in his career, Beverley made three All-Defensive teams — two with the Rockets (2014 and 2017) and one with the Clippers (2020).\",\n",

       "   'content': 'Cleveland Cavaliers guard Donovan Mitchell is interviewed after the NBA All-Star Game at Vivint Arena in Salt Lake City on Feb. 19, 2023. The former Jazz star netted 40 points in his first All-Star Game as a starter.Ryan Sun, Deseret News In 2018 Donovan Mitchell was on a flight to Los Angeles for All-Star Weekend. With him were a number of higher-ups within the Jazz organization who told him that they were going to be submitting a bid to host the All-Star Game in 2023. “I grew up here, as a player, as a person, as a man. Then to be back here as a starter. It’s one of those things — like I was a Cleveland fan growing up, so that’s a full-circle moment.” — Donovan Mitchell Mitchell signed a jersey on that flight that said, “We hope to see you in 2023.”On Sunday night Mitchell played in Salt Lake City as an All-Star starter for Team Giannis in the 2023 All-Star Game at Vivint Arena. Though it wasn’t as a member of the Utah Jazz, it was still special for Mitchell and it was one of many moments that felt like everything just lined up and happened as it was supposed to.“I grew up here, as a player, as a person, as a man,” Mitchell said after the game on Sunday. “Then to be back here as a starter. It’s one of those things — like I was a Cleveland fan growing up, so that’s a full-circle moment. You have all these full-circle moments. I’m in Cleveland and then come back here for All-Star, it’s almost like it makes sense. I think it’s truly special.”Although Mitchell was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers in the offseason, Jazz brass were pretty happy when they learned that Mitchell was voted an All-Star starter this year.“We thought to ourselves, how cool is it that Donovan will see us in 2023,” former executive vice president of the Utah Jazz, Don Stirling said.With the luxury of still owning a home in Salt Lake City, Mitchell was able to come back to comfort for the All-Star break, but that didn’t mean that he wasn’t going to be busy. On top of attending multiple events throughout the weekend, Mitchell also hosted a comedy show in Salt Lake, of which the proceeds went to Kearns High. Related What Donovan Mitchell said about his favorite shot of his career and Jazz fans Nobody knew what to expect, but Donovan Mitchell’s return was overwhelmingly positive ‘Pretty surreal’: Lauri Markkanen enjoys first appearance as All-Star Game returns to Utah “That, for me, is one of my prouder moments,” Mitchell said. “Still being able to give back even though I’m not here — that’s forever going to stay with me … Then the game. It’s one of those things — my first time as a starter — you’ll never forget. Like I said, I came in here as a young kid and started to grow up a little bit. For me to be here in this moment and in this position, God is good, and I’m forever grateful.”In the actual main event, Mitchell started out the night with an assist. Moments after the All-Star Game started, Mitchell threw up a lob to Utah Jazz All-Star starter Lauri Markkanen and the crowd went wild.\\xa0It felt like an official passing of the torch. The Jazz were once Mitchell’s team, and now Markkanen is the best player on the Jazz roster. Though there was no discussion beforehand about the play — it was just something that happened naturally — the symbolism was not lost on Mitchell.“It’s one of those things, just another one of those moments,” he said. “It’s just funny how those things work out … I’ve known Lauri for a while. It’s great to see him out here thriving, and it was great to have that moment.”Mitchell had plenty of his own standout moments throughout the night. There was a point in the third quarter when it wasn’t clear who was going to run away and take the All-Star MVP award — Mitchell, or Team Giannis teammate Jayson Tatum.

Ryan Sun, Deseret News 119 of 119 Eventually it was Tatum that would go on to break the All-Star single game scoring record, closing the night out with 55 points.\\xa0“There was a point in time where I was like, ‘Hey, I need an assist.’ That’s why I gave the ball back to him, and he ended up shooting it and making it,” Mitchell said. “At the end of the day he caught fire. It’s all love.”But Mitchell had a very respectable 40 points on the night and was very happy for Tatum, who Mitchell has known since high school. Just another full-circle moment.There could be more of those waiting for Mitchell in the future. Who knows, someday he could end up playing in the Finals against the Jazz. No matter the circumstances, Mitchell likes being in Utah and is happy when he gets a chance to come back. This time, it just felt a little more special, after watching all of the work behind the scenes to make it all happen.“I’m honored to be here, honored to be back,” he said. “The love I’ve received is awesome.” Cleveland Cavaliers guard Donovan Mitchell shoots over New York Knicks forward Julius Randle during the NBA All-Star Game at Vivint Arena Sunday Feb. 19, 2023.

       "   'content': 'Plus, the pressure on Steichen in Indy, how Washington landed Eric Bieniemy and more.More MMQB: A Forgotten Play Set the Tone for Super Bowl LVII | A Deeper Look at Jonathan Gannon | A Farewell Q&A With Chad HenneThe franchise-tag window opens Monday, and it closes in two weeks. And if history is any indication, most teams considering using the tag will let things play out over the full two weeks before making a final call—there’s really no advantage to doing it earlier rather than later.Here, then, are the tag numbers for 2023 …• QB: $32,416,000• RB: $10,091,000• WR: $19,743,000• TE: $11,345,000• OL: $18,244,000• DE: $19,727,000• DT: $18,937,000• LB: $20,926,000• CB: $18,140,000• S: $14,460,000• K/P: $5,393,000Obviously, the big question is whether the Ravens will tag Lamar Jackson, and we’ll get to that here in a second. But teams like the Giants (Saquon Barkley/Daniel Jones), Raiders (Josh Jacobs), Bengals (Jessie Bates), Cowboys (Dalton Schultz/Tony Pollard), Chiefs (Orlando Brown), Seahawks (Geno Smith) and Commanders (Daron Payne) have decisions to make, too. Lamar Jackson will get tagged—one way or another—by Baltimore.Tommy Gilligan/USA TODAY Sports And on Lamar Jackson, the big question isn’t whether the Ravens will tag him. It’s which tag they’ll use. As you can see, the quarterback tag is $32.4 million. The exclusive tag—and this can change, with new quarterback contracts coming in or old quarterback contracts being restructured—stands at $45.46 million right now.We went over this last week in The MAQB, but it’s worth reiterating that each tag sends a very different message. The former exposes the Ravens to another team signing Jackson to an offer sheet and finding a way to (even though it’s technically against the rules) poison-pill the contract for the Ravens. To do it, Baltimore has to at least be comfortable with moving on from Jackson and getting two first-round picks in return. The latter would take Jackson off the market completely, and say, more or less, He’s going nowhere.So why wouldn’t the Ravens just put the exclusive tag on him? Mostly because it would make a contract harder to negotiate. Your starting point, off that tag, would have to be a two-year guarantee of over $100 million (the sum of two exclusive franchise tags), because that’s the route you’d have to persuade Jackson not to take. And even then, he’d have the option to not sign it, with no penalty for not showing up until September (when he’d start losing game checks off that tag).Which way will the Ravens go? To me, it’s still incredibly unpredictable, because Jackson has handled this the same way he plays—uniquely.And there’s a part of me, based on what I know, that believes this is still a play on principle for Jackson. He’s taken an unprecedented number of hits for a quarterback through five years on a rookie deal, so it would be wholly understandable if he looked sideways at a conventional quarterback contract offer that would give Baltimore injury protection down the line.No matter how you slice it, this isn’t going to be an easy one for the Ravens. It will start with their first move.The early stages of Steichen’s run in Indianapolis are going to be judged, fair or not, on one thing—and that’s whether or not he can get the quarterback position straightened out. From the minute the Colts pulled the plug on Frank Reich, there was really no gray area on what it was about—getting the quarterback right. Indy had already benched Matt Ryan to get a look at Sam Ehlinger. Reich’s OC, Marcus Brady, had been fired. And Jim Irsay’s fingerprints were all over it.Whispers, pretty loud ones, at the time were that Irsay wanted to get the quarterback position right, for the long term, once and for all. No more bridge guys (like Matt Ryan or Philip Rivers), no more reclamation projects (like Carson Wentz). The logic then followed that either Ehlinger and Jeff Saturday would thrive, or the team would sink to the bottom of the league and be in position to set the organization up to get one in the draft. We know how that turned out.So Irsay’s hinting that the team likes Bryce Young last week or confirming that they’re planning to take a quarterback in the top five was hardly news to anyone in the building. And ultimately, that’s what hiring Steichen is about, too—getting a coach who could work with different types of quarterbacks and have him at the side of whomever the rookie coming in winds up being.The good news? Steichen is pretty qualified when it comes to this. He had a very close relationship with Rivers, both as position coach and coordinator, in San Diego and Los Angeles, then helped a rookie Justin Herbert acclimate to the NFL in the COVID-19 year of 2020 (Herbert won Offensive Rookie of the Year) before building an offense for Hurts the last two years that blended NFL pass-game concepts with an Oklahoma run-game foundation.True to all that, here’s what Steichen said he’ll look for in a young quarterback: “Accuracy, decision-making and the ability to create are the three things I look at in a quarterback. I think all three things are very important. But obviously, above the neck, the players I’ve been around—Jalen Hurts, Justin Herbert and Philip Rivers—they all have one thing in common: They’re obsessed with their craft. If you can find that in a quarterback, you’ll probably have some success.”Which is to say, Steichen will be flexible, to a degree, in assessing Young, C.J. Stroud, Will Levis and Anthony Richardson, in envisioning how the Colts would work around each guy’s strengths and weaknesses. And that’s a great thing for Indy, in that it will allow GM Chris Ballard and his staff to look at each guy with an open mind.That said, make no mistake, Steichen and Ballard have to get this one right, if the way the owner has handled the last six months is any indication of what he expects. Bieniemy takes over as offensive coordinator in Washington.Mark J. Rebilas/USA TODAY Sports Commanders coach Ron Rivera deserves credit for taking a big swing on Eric Bieniemy. The tough reality for Rivera—following the dismissal of offensive coordinator Scott Turner—was that selling his open position to a coach with options wasn’t going to be easy. The team missed the playoffs the last two years and is about to be sold. And the new owner, presuming Dan Snyder doesn’t play Lucy and pull the football away at the last minute (which can’t be totally ruled out), very well might want his own people in 2024.That’s why a lot of folks leaguewide, and even inside Ashburn, thought Rivera would end up turning to quarterbacks coach Ken Zampese, who’s at least been a coordinator before. Instead, Rivera gets Patrick Mahomes’s OC, and gets him with the Chiefs coming off their second championship, and third Super Bowl, in four years. K.C. is also coming off its fifth straight home AFC title game, a stretch that encompasses the five years Bieniemy has run their offense. Which, at least on paper, would seem to be a wildly unlikely development. Based on what I know, it went down for a couple of reasons.First, there’s the relationship that Rivera has with Andy Reid. Rivera coached linebackers for Reid for five years in Philadelphia (1999 to 2003), and views him as a coaching mentor. The two have stayed close, serving together on the coaches subcommittee (also known as the Madden Committee), and working together on a number of leaguewide initiatives. Getting good intel on Bieniemy’s availability was never going to be a problem.Second, there’s Bieniemy’s frustration. He’s had 16 head coaching interviews (the Jets interviewed him twice). This offseason he interviewed with an executive he worked with in Kansas City in Colts GM Chris Ballard. And I don’t know if anyone tracks this stuff, but he has to have been told, Thanks, but no thanks, more times than anyone in league history. I can’t blame him for getting sick of it and wanting to try to change something. This also allows him to change the narrative—from being Reid’s and Mahomes’s OC, to just being a good football coach again. If this does that for him, then it makes a ton of sense. And if you’re Bieniemy, as much as you might look at the NFL’s larger problem of a lack of diversity at the top of the coaching ranks—and you want to be part of the fix—you also have your own personal goals. If one of those goals is being a head coach, it’s easy to see where this move is logical, especially when you consider that, even if there were to be changes in Ashburn a year from now, you’re established enough to get another coordinator job elsewhere in the league.As for that first point, again, that relationship was part of how this all went down, and part of a pretty interesting month in getting here for Rivera, because …The Commanders getting Bieniemy actually started with them missing on him. For the same reason other head coaches may not have considered getting the Chiefs’ OC realistic, the idea didn’t really cross Rivera’s mind in the aftermath of Turner’s firing, which went down two days after Washington’s season ended.Then, Rivera started digging into what he wanted to build offensively and was studying quick-game concepts of three- and five-step drops to get the ball to Terry McLaurin, Curtis Samuel and Jahan Doston faster and highlight the strengths of Sam Howell coming out of his rookie year. He kept coming back to two things—what the Chiefs do offensively and the fact that Bieniemy had signed a series of one-year deals.So the second week of the offseason, he huddled with front-office types Martin Mayhew, Marty Hurney, Rob Rogers, Eric Stokes and Chris Polian, and put Bieniemy on the list. The only problem was that the window to interview assistant coaches from the No. 1 seeds had already closed and, because the Commanders hadn’t conducted a first interview, they wouldn’t be able to get to Bieniemy during the second-interview window for Super Bowl teams during the bye week ahead of the big game.Rivera told the front office guys, more or less, We need to wait. So they did, going through other candidates in the meantime and biding their time.Last week, Rivera and Reid talked a number of times, and Reid was very supportive of the idea, believing it could benefit both his former assistant and his current assistant. And Rivera could recall one other time Reid had put in that sort of stamp of approval—it was for former Eagles assistant Sean McDermott before Rivera hired McDermott as his defensive coordinator in 2011. Which led into last week’s three-day interview (dinner Wednesday, interview Thursday, staffing and contract discussion Friday). Over that time, Bieniemy showed deep knowledge of the Commanders’ offensive roster; presented a detailed plan to get the ball in the hands of guys like McLaurin, Dotson and Samuel; and explained how he’d leverage the creativity Kansas City has thrived on for a decade in Washington.And Bieniemy also went deep on the Dallas game, which was Howell’s lone start, and into how quick the quarterback was getting the ball out, his decision-making and his footwork.By then, Rivera had cross-checked Bieniemy with the Chiefs’ other coordinators, Steve Spagnuolo and Dave Toub, and got glowing reviews back, which, really, only made this more about whether Bieniemy would take the job than whether the Commanders would offer it. Both guys affirmed what Rivera had seen: Bieniemy had some traits that all Reid assistants seem to have, in his confidence to command a room and lead (some of his hand gestures even reminded Rivera a little of Reid).Now Rivera has his guy. And, again, considering the situation he’s in, with ownership and everything else in Washington, this is a pretty good get.I really like what the Panthers are doing with their coaching staff. You’ve seen the hires. David Tepper struck a check to convince Ejiro Evero to come to Carolina, rather than go to Minnesota with his buddy Kevin O’Connell. They pried the Rams’ assistant head coach, Thomas Brown, from Los Angeles to be their OC and bring some McVay influence to their offense. They’ve hired respected position coaches like Duce Staley (who will also be assistant head coach) and Shawn Jefferson, and taken chances on guys like DeAngelo Hall. And it all goes back to what owner David Tepper said: There’s no salary cap on coaches.In Tepper’s hiring go-round, that meant giving then Baylor coach Matt Rhule a seven-year, $63 million deal to choose Carolina over his dream job with the Giants. In Round 2, it’s meant surrounding Frank Reich with a staff stocked with rising coaches and established teachers, and it’s going to be fascinating to see how this turns out.To be sure, there are owners in the NFL who’d prefer that spending on coaches—both on the guys in charge and their assistants—stay under control. Some have even worked to ensure it. But with the deal Sean Payton got in Denver from the league’s newest owners, and what the league’s second-newest owner is doing in Charlotte, and what happened last year (with what Miami’s Steve Ross, who just paid his new DC nearly $5 million per, offered Payton), it’s clear where the tide is going on all this.I say good. Owners should be investing money back into the product, and I applaud Tepper for doing that. Now, if the owners would only do the same with officiating and the fields, we’d be all set.Somehow, the coaching carousel is still spinning with a week left until the combine. We’re here for it, and for you, with some quick-hitters on it to wrap up the Takeaways …• It sure looks like Brian Johnson is staying in Philly, after walking away from the chance to join Frank Reich’s all-star staff in Carolina. Which means he’s in line, once the proper search process is complete, to succeed Steichen as Eagles offensive coordinator.• That would probably free up Kevin Patullo to return to Indy, where he was receivers coach under Reich, as Steichen’s offensive coordinator, once their process is complete.• As for the defensive coordinator job in Philly, Eagles passing-game coordinator Dennard Wilson remains one to watch for a promotion into that role. As we’ve mentioned before, Vic Fangio and Jerod Mayo were high on the list as potential Gannon replacements, but both were spoken for contractually by the time Gannon landed the Arizona job.• Bieniemy is likely to bring a couple of coaches with him to Washington, and there could be added responsibilities for assistant line coach Travelle Wharton with the Commanders as well. Wharton, who played 10 years in the league, has been an assistant line coach for Rivera for five years now (two in Carolina, three in Washington).• Mike Westhoff’s return to the NFL with the Broncos—he and Payton have been talking about it for a few weeks—is interesting in that it ends the 75-year-old’s second retirement. Westhoff first walked away at the end of 2012 after 12 years with the Jets. He returned in ’17 for two seasons with the Saints before walking away again. And now he’s back, and I’m told it’s only happening because he’s with the one head coach he’d return to work with at his age.• While we’re there, Rex Ryan was with the Broncos over the weekend, too, and Denver’s interest in him, and also Vance Joseph and Mike Zimmer (added to the Westhoff hire), is a pretty good indication that Payton wants experienced hands around him. Having it that way, of course, will free him up to build the offense and work with Russell Wilson.• The addition of Patriots-connected assistants Nick Caley and Ryan Wendell to the Rams’ offensive staff is a pretty good sign of the respect Sean McVay has for Belichick, and also for what McDaniels was able to build on that side of the ball in Foxboro.• After Matt Nagy officially takes over for Bieniemy as Chiefs OC, his old job, as Kansas City’s quarterbacks coach, should be a sought-after one. But assistant quarterbacks coach David Girardi would probably be first in line to replace him, with quality-control coach Porter Ellett potentially then replacing Girardi as assistant QBs coach.• Good move by Kellen Moore to get Doug Nussmeier to come with him to the Chargers to work with Herbert. Nussmeier was an OC at five different schools, has been coaching quarterbacks for more than 20 years and played the position in the league. He should be a pretty good resource to the young quarterback, on top of what Moore will bring.• Dave Canales left the Seahawks to become Bucs OC last week, and I figured that he’d probably have to be the last guy left from Pete Carroll’s original Seattle staff. I figured wrong! Tight ends coach Pat McPherson and senior offensive assistant Nate Carroll, Pete’s youngest son, also go all the way back to 2010 with the team.SIX FROM THE SIDELINESWith football season complete and draft season starting, the college prospecting will start to be folded more into the NFL stuff in columns. Which is where we annually transition Six From Saturday to the Six from the Sidelines. So it’s time for this week’s thoughts on … whatever.1. We all complain about the Pro Bowl, but the fact that I had so much trouble mustering up even a little interest in the NBA All-Star Game is as good a sign as any how obsolete these exhibitions have become. I’m not saying they should disband them—I think they serve a purpose, which is for the stars of each sport to get together in one place to celebrate their game. I actually like that part of it. But with so much access on TV and the internet to the stars of every sport, the appeal of just getting to see them, much less in a game that doesn’t matter, isn’t close to what it once was. So I think the leagues should just make these as fun as they can and use them to build relationships within their ranks, with any sort of money-making element secondary to that.2. You is a pretty awesome TV series. And yeah, I know it’s four years old, and there are four seasons. But my wife just got me on to it on Netflix, and I’m almost through the first season. It’s definitely worth checking out.3. I love Chris Holtmann and really hope he makes it out of this year, and we get a chance to see what he can do with a great recruiting class—which could include Bronny James—next year. I know it’s been our AD Gene Smith’s plan to let Holtmann see that through. But I can’t remember Ohio State basketball being this sort of terrible in a long, long time—a 1–13 stretch is pretty unacceptable.4. I couldn’t get to much XFL this week. I’ll try to help you out on that next week. But for now, I can say that I’ve heard from people in the league, as Dwayne Johnson has addressed the team. And to a man, they all say he’s been great, coming off as very genuine and with a real plan—one that’s largely based on becoming a resource for the NFL—that might actually work.5. One thing I legitimately love about how Nick Saban has built his program is that Alabama is never afraid to bring in an outside voice from which he can learn. So it was cool to see, last week, the Tide hire former Cardinals and Titans coach Ken Whisenhunt as a special assistant to the head coach. At an age (71) when most people become more closed-minded, it feels like Saban, over the last decade, has gone the other way, and that’s been to the benefit of Bama and college football.6. The Kevin Durant experiment in Phoenix should be fascinating and help define how we remember him as a player 20 years from now. That group was good enough to nearly win it all a couple of years ago without him, but this situation still is significantly different than when Durant jumped on the Warriors’ freight train in 2017. He’s got a pretty excellent opportunity here.ONE THING YOU NEED TO KNOWI’ll be skiing with the kids all week for their school vacation, and that will mean a little less from me on social media and on the site. But we’ll still have everything that happens over the next few days covered on there, and I’ll be back with my annual pre-combine primer on the draft class for next Monday. See you all then!',\n",

       "   'description': 'The annual demand for quarterbacks is running high once again, and several teams could eventually look to trade up to secure their passer of choice. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0',\n",
       "   'content': \"GLENDALE, Ariz. – With Super Bowl 57 already receding into the desert horizon, the NFL's offseason is officially here in force. The annual quarterback carousel has already begun spinning amid Derek Carr's release in Las Vegas , and the coming days will be flecked with talk of franchise tags and such. But the league's annual scouting combine isn't two weeks away – and that means the opening of draft season. Yay. Naturally, that means mock drafts – even if these early iterations are inherently flawed by the lack of insight that free agency and trades will provide. But let's not allow that to stop premature projections of how Round 1 of the 2023 draft will unfold ( Note: The Miami Dolphins, who were scheduled to select 21st, forfeited their pick for illegally tampering with QB Tom Brady and coach Sean Payton when they were under contract with other clubs): 1. Chicago Bears – DT Jalen Carter, Georgia A plethora of options here, and GM Ryan Poles has numerous needs to address. Pass rusher should most certainly be under consideration for a team that recorded a league-low 20 sacks. Offensive line would make sense given the Bears need to put more pieces (and protection) around QB Justin Fields. Trading down a few spots with a team in need of a franchise passer obviously is a viable path – though Poles didn't completely rule out a quarterback for himself, and that would open up an entirely different can of worms. But let's go with Carter to anchor a defense that surrendered the most points in the league and was the NFC's worst against the run (157.3 yards allowed per game). The 6-3, 300-pounder's sack numbers (3 last year) won't wow you. But the All-American is cat quick, lines up at all points along the front, can push the pocket and gets exceptional penetration and is especially effective at swallowing running backs. Chicago coach Matt Eberflus, who previously ran the Colts defense, might see his new version of DeForest Buckner. 2. Houston Texans – QB Bryce Young, Alabama He can sling it, never better than in 2021 when he won the Heisman Trophy. That season, Young finished with 4,872 yards and 47 TDs through the air. He's accurate (66% completion rate in college) and his career 80-to-12 touchdown-to-interception ratio is indicative of solid decision-making. Young is highly mobile, though typically buys time to pass and does a nice job keeping his eyes downfield – a la peak Russell Wilson. The combine will officially determine whether he's 6 feet and/or 200 pounds, either figure likely to concern his next team – especially since Young won't be afforded the same level of protection he was at Alabama. 3. Arizona Cardinals – OLB Will Anderson Jr., Alabama Schematically, he was probably a better fit with the 3-4 front the Cards had used in recent seasons. But you don't say no when you get the chance to take someone with Anderson's characteristics given his size (6-4, 243 pounds), burst and power. And given the success new head coach Jonathan Gannon had deploying LB Haason Reddick, who's smaller than Anderson, on the edge in Philadelphia, there should be no issues here. The two-time SEC Defensive Player of the Year was truly spectacular in 2021, when he led the country with 17½ sacks and 31 tackles for loss. 4. Indianapolis Colts – QB C.J. Stroud, Ohio State After its 2022 crash and burn, time for this organization to reset under center with youth rather than continuing to play musical chairs with fading veterans. New HC Shane Steichen has been coordinating offenses since 2019 and been quite successful with a range of quarterbacks including Philip Rivers, Justin Herbert and Jalen Hurts. Of that group, Stroud (6-3, 215 pounds) most closely resembles Herbert as he's accurate (69.3% completion rate in college), productive (85 TD passes, 12 INTs, 182.4 passer rating over last two seasons) and athletic – but, like Herbert, more inclined to extend plays to throw rather than break the pocket. Stroud was on the losing end of both his starts against Michigan and in a 2023 College Football Playoff semifinal against Georgia – but he was spectacular in that final game, passing for 348 yards and four TDs against an awesome Bulldogs defense. 5. Seattle Seahawks (from Denver Broncos) – DE Tyree Wilson, Texas Tech Assuming QB Geno Smith re-signs, they won't have to burn this valuable selection obtained in the Wilson trade on another passer – and most likely not on an already solid offense. But reinforcements for a defense that hasn't ranked better than 22nd since 2018 are long overdue. Wilson, a 6-6, 275-pound edge rusher with 14 sacks and 27½ TFLs over the past two seasons, should provide needed pressure that would make a young group of cornerbacks shine even more. 6. Detroit Lions (from Los Angeles Rams) – CB Devon Witherspoon, Illinois As satisfied as they seem with QB Jared Goff, this might be the Lions' last best chance to take a young quarterback knowing Goff's contract only runs two more seasons. But barring that, Detroit has to alter what was statistically the league's worst defense in 2022. As disappointing as Jeff Okudah and these corners have generally been, Witherspoon makes perfect sense – and his willingness to tackle and mix it up behind the line of scrimmage while taking on runners seem to be a good fit for a Dan Campbell-coached team. 7. Las Vegas Raiders – OT Peter Skoronski, Northwestern A number of directions they can go following the release of Carr, though the guess here is the Silver and Black will pursue a veteran replacement in free agency. A 28th-ranked defense is also in dire need of help. But with starting RT Jermaine Eluemunor unsigned, Skoronski could upgrade that spot opposite established Kolton Miller but also transition back to the left side down the road. 8. Atlanta Falcons – QB Anthony Richardson, Florida Should be a fascinating offseason in the ATL, where the Falcons are positioned to make a splash in free agency and should challenge for the NFC South title in 2023. Yet, even though QB Desmond Ridder is coming off his rookie season, Atlanta – owner Arthur Blank had his team in the running for Deshaun Watson last year – will have a prime opportunity to reinvest at the position with a talent like Richardson. At 6-4, 232 pounds with a huge arm and the ability to bowl over or outrun defenders, the skill set is tantalizing. He could also clearly benefit from a season (or more) to marinate under HC Arthur Smith and work on his accuracy while the less physically gifted Ridder's evaluation continues. But Smith's penchant for extracting the most from his players and the prospect of Richardson eventually joining an offense with several promising young players could make him hard to bypass. 9. Carolina Panthers – QB Will Levis, Kentucky Fairly or not – OK, not – the strong-armed, athletic, 6-3, 232-pounder is going to draw comparisons to the likes of Matthew Stafford and Josh Allen. But Levis needs to improve his consistency and footwork while recovering from the physical beating he endured in 2022. New HC Frank Reich might be the guy to help iron out those issues. Probably be a good idea to have a veteran on hand so Levis wouldn't have to play before he's ready for the NFL, however this team also appears ready to win provided it can stabilize the situation under center. 10. Philadelphia Eagles (from New Orleans Saints) – DT Bryan Bresee, Clemson A guy who can play up and down the line, Bresee (6-5, 300 pounds) fits the profile of a Philly first-rounder – and especially in a year when the team's defensive tackle depth will likely be decimated with Javon Hargrave, Fletcher Cox, Ndamukong Suh and Linval Joseph ticketed for free agency. 11. Tennessee Titans – WR Quentin Johnston, TCU The offense seemingly never recovered from the highly debated draft night trade of A.J. Brown last year. Johnston is big (6-4, 215 pounds) and explosive and – in concert with 2022 first-rounder Treylon Burks – could open up the field for RB Derrick Henry while providing a massive target for whoever is playing quarterback in Nashville next season. 12. Texans (from Cleveland Browns) – TE Michael Mayer, Notre Dame He catches (138 receptions for 1,649 yards over past two seasons), he blocks, he scores (16 TDs over past two seasons), and the 2022 All-American is huge (6-4, 265 pounds). Is there a better way to help a young quarterback and RB Dameon Pierce? 13. New York Jets – OT Paris Johnson Jr., Ohio State It seems a given the NYJ will acquire a veteran quarterback this spring, so it stands to reason they should bolster an offensive line set to lose starting OT George Fant and C Connor McGovern in free agency. Johnson (6-6, 310 pounds) would assume the left tackle job Mekhi Becton hasn't been healthy (or nimble) enough to hold down. If Becton gets on the field in 2023, slot him for the right side. 14. New England Patriots – WR Jordan Addison, USC Bill Belichick's poor history drafting receivers can't be denied, but that doesn't change the fact a 20th-ranked passing offense doesn't have even a 600-yard receiver under contract going into 2023 with WRs Jakobi Meyers and Nelson Agholor on the way out. At 6 feet, 175 pounds, Addison's on the slight side but was highly productive at Pitt (100 catches for 1,593 yards and 17 TDs in 2021) before transferring to the Trojans and leading them with 59 grabs for 875 yards and eight scores last year despite missing time with an ankle injury. His ability to play wide or in the slot should appeal to Belichick. 15. Green Bay Packers – DB Brian Branch, Alabama Whether the 6-foot, 193-pound All-American lines up in the slot, safety, corner or all of the above, the Pack's secondary needs the help. Branch had two INTs, three sacks and 14 TFLs in 2022. 16. Washington Commanders – CB Joey Porter Jr., Penn State The son of the former Steelers linebacking star of the same name, Porter Jr. is a big (6-2, 194) corner who could plug in nicely for a team that could use quality depth beyond what Kendall Fuller provides. 17. Pittsburgh Steelers – OT Broderick Jones, Georgia As much as they're counting on Kenny Pickett – almost indisputably the worst quarterback in the AFC North, even if he blossoms into a Pro Bowler in 2023 – it's high time to invest in the protection in front of him, which would also surely meet with RB Najee Harris' approval, too. 18. Lions – DE Myles Murphy, Clemson Another asset for Detroit's defense. The productive All-ACC edge man had 18½ sacks and 36 TFLs in three seasons with the Tigers and would make a nice bookend with DE Aidan Hutchinson. 19. Tampa Bay Buccaneers – CB Christian Gonzalez, Oregon The Brady-less, capped-out Bucs seem headed for an overhaul. But with DBs Jamel Dean, Mike Edwards, Logan Ryan and Sean Murphy-Bunting all headed for the open market, a talented corner like Gonzalez seems a like a logical choice. 20. Seahawks – G O'Cyrus Torrence, Florida Seattle still gave up too many sacks in 2022 – can't blame Wilson for those – and could also use a mauler to further Pete Carroll's desire to run the ball with RB Kenneth Walker III and Co. 21. Los Angeles Chargers – WR Jaxon Smith-Njigba, Ohio State Are you getting the guy who racked up 347 receiving yards in the 2022 Rose Bowl? Or the guy who missed most of last season with a hamstring injury, which spurred a lot of questions? Maybe both. But with Keenan Allen slowing down and maybe about to be a cap casualty, Smith-Njigba would make an outstanding Robin to Mike Williams' Batman in this offense. 22. Baltimore Ravens – CB Kelee Ringo, Georgia What better way to replace a big, physical corner like Marcus Peters than with a big, physical corner like Ringo ... though he's not the takeaway machine Peters is. 23. Minnesota Vikings – OLB Nolan Smith, Georgia One way to address the NFC's worst pass defense? Infuse more juice into its pass rush, and Smith can do just that – especially if he's allowed to start out with a focus on sub packages and passing downs. 24. Jacksonville Jaguars – TE Dalton Kincaid, Utah The Jags' top three tight ends are unsigned. Kincaid, an All-Pac-12 player (70 catches, 890 yards, 8 TDs) in 2022, might be better than all of them and would give QB Trevor Lawrence another dangerous weapon for an ascending offense. 25. New York Giants – WR Zay Flowers, Boston College Like (injured) 2022 second-rounder Wan'Dale Robinson, he's diminutive (5-10, 172 pounds). But Big Blue really needs bodies for its receiving corps, Sterling Shepard already dropped into the free agent market. Flowers is a weapon in the slot, from where he'll occasionally motion into a jet sweep (57 rushes in four seasons). 26. Dallas Cowboys – CB Cam Smith, South Carolina A big corner (6 feet, 188 pounds) who can play wide or in the slot and should definitely flourish while improving coverage opposite Trevon Diggs if he takes No. 1 receivers. 27. Buffalo Bills – RB Bijan Robinson, Texas This has to be the year Buffalo pulls the trigger on an every-down back to reduce the rushing load on QB Josh Allen, right? Especially with Devin Singletary's contract expiring? Quite the workhorse, Robinson had more than 3,300 yards from scrimmage over the past two seasons and averaged 6.7 yards per touch. 28. Cincinnati Bengals – S Antonio Johnson, Texas A&M The All-SEC performer can line up just about anywhere, including the slot, and is an effective defender in coverage and coming up to shut down the run. His 6-3 frame would come in handy in a division with TEs like Baltimore's Mark Andrews and Pittsburgh's Pat Freiermuth. A good chunk of Cincy's secondary is unsigned, including starting safeties Jessie Bates III and Vonn Bell. 29. Saints (from San Francisco 49ers via Dolphins and Broncos) – DE Lukas Van Ness, Iowa New Orleans picked up this peripatetic pick by letting Payton go to Denver. Van Ness should be an every-down player who can line up outside or in depending on the situation. And with this D-line set to lose David Onyemata, Marcus Davenport and Shy Tuttle, a versatile replacement who can get to the quarterback – Van Ness has 13 sacks and 17 TFLs over the past two seasons – would provide welcome support to aging DE Cam Jordan, 33. 30. Eagles – CB Deonte Banks, Maryland A sizable corner (6-2, 205) with the ability to press, he could potentially plug into a secondary that probably can't afford to keep CB James Bradberry. 31. Kansas City Chiefs – OLB/DE Andre Carter II, Army He's got an outside shot to be the first West Pointer taken in Round 1 in the NFL's common draft era (since 1967) ... even if a player like Georgia Tech's Keion White is probably an easier evaluation here. But when you're 6-7 and 260 pounds, Carter must be on the radar. His 15½ sacks in 2021 ranked second only to Anderson nationally and earned him a spot on that season's third-team All-American squad. Carter – or, sure, White – could give the champs a nice edge mix with veteran Frank Clark and 2022 first-rounder George Karlaftis. *** Follow USA TODAY Sports' Nate Davis on Twitter @ByNateDavis .\",\n",

       "   'content': 'SALT LAKE CITY -- It\\'s safe to say people know who Mac McClung is now. Once the poster boy for the NBA All-Star slam dunk contest\\'s path toward irrelevance, sporting a field of obscure participants rather than the certified stars of the past, McClung stole the show as if he were Michael Jordan or Dominique Wilkins. With only two games of NBA experience under his belt during stints with the Los Angeles Lakers and Chicago Bulls, McClung was signed to a two-way contract by the Philadelphia 76ers earlier in the week and dominated Saturday\\'s dunk contest with a near-perfect performance. \"It kind of feels, ever since the beginning, I was the underdog,\" McClung said. \"... Just proving yourself right, not others wrong, it brings a little more satisfaction.\" Three of McClung\\'s four dunks earned him straight 50s by the panel of judges, and he completed all of them on his first attempt, generating a palpable buzz through the Vivint Arena crowd as he prepared for every subsequent stuff. McClung gained an online following in high school for YouTube compilations of his dunks that seemed otherworldly for a player who is now listed at a generous 6-foot-2 and 185 pounds. Despite his size, McClung said watching the classic showdown between Zach LaVine and Aaron Gordon in the 2016 dunk contest made him dream about being a part of it someday. He opened Saturday\\'s contest with 50s across the board as he took the ball from a friend sitting on another friend\\'s shoulders -- Chase Skinkis, who identifies himself as a \"vertical jump specialist,\" and high school buddy Bradley Dean -- and tapped it against the backboard first before putting it through the hoop. \"We just wanted to try to make something up that we haven\\'t seen before, and the first dunk, I hadn\\'t seen before, so hopefully, it\\'s not out there,\" McClung said. His second dunk -- a whirling helicopter, two-handed, 360-degree stuff -- earned him a 49.8. Lisa Leslie was the only judge to prevent him from opening up with two straight perfect scores. McClung started the final round by again taking the ball from another friend holding it over his head -- just one person this time, Skinkis -- and performed a pronounced double pump before finishing the dunk with a two-handed reverse. He earned another 50. For his final flourish, McClung put on his Gate City (Va.) high school uniform over his red Sixers jersey and threw down a 540-degree two-handed dunk -- one-and-a-half turns in the air -- to run away with the trophy. The judges -- Karl Malone, Jamal Crawford, Harold Miner, Wilkins and Leslie -- all gave him a 50 once again. \"Being from a small town, Gate City, of 1,600 people, and now we\\'re on this stage,\" McClung said. \"It was just unbelievable.\" After his final dunk, McClung was surrounded by a euphoric group of All-Stars in attendance, stunned by what they just witnessed. He motioned to the camera, \"It\\'s over!\" -- mimicking Kenny Smith\\'s famous broadcast call during Vince Carter\\'s legendary dunk contest win in Oakland, California, in 2000. \"I think something took over me; I don\\'t know what that was,\" McClung said of the gesture. \"I wasn\\'t really thinking in the moment; it\\'s just something that happened, to be honest with you.\" McClung said he wasn\\'t able to finish the 540-degree dunk in practice but that he had confidence in the moment, based on how his night was going, to pull it off. He edged out Trey Murphy III of the New Orleans Pelicans in the final round. Jericho Sims of the New York Knicks and Kenyon Martin Jr. of the Houston Rockets bowed out after the first round. Julius \"Dr. J\" Erving presented the trophy to McClung at center court. The NBA redesigned the dunk contest trophy this year and named it after the Sixers legend. McClung said he would be back to defend his crown at next year\\'s All-Star Game in Indianapolis, if the league invites him back. \"It\\'s all been a blur,\" McClung said. \"You can really do whatever you want to do. ... If you manifest and put your mind to it, you can literally make your life and reinvent yourself every day.\" This week, he will rejoin the 76ers, looking to crack coach Doc Rivers\\' rotation as the team prepares for the playoffs. \"I\\'m not really worried what other people think, good or bad, I\\'m staying the course,\" McClung said when asked about his breakout night. \"My goal is to make an impact in the NBA, and I\\'m just going to keep working until that happens.\"',\n",

To wrap up what the event meant to Salt Lake City and the state of Utah, to determine if it was all as successful as everyone had hoped it would be.It’s a tall task that I wasn’t sure I’d be able to pull off.To be perfectly honest with you, everything was feeling like a huge blur, with the days all bleeding into one another. My coverage of All-Star Weekend started well before the weekend and by Saturday afternoon I was running on fumes and just waiting for the whole thing to be done.\\xa0But on Saturday night, as I watched how much fun Jazz rookie Walker Kessler was having becoming an All-Star Skills Challenge champion alongside Collin Sexton and Jordan Clarkson, and then watched Mac McClung breathe life back into the Dunk Contest, I remembered what this weekend is about. Related ‘Pretty surreal’: Lauri Markkanen enjoys first appearance as All-Star Game returns to Utah All-Star Weekend is a celebration of basketball. It allows greatness to have its moment and it showcases the most impressive talent from the most powerful basketball league in the world.It’s also a celebration of the host city and a chance for the NBA world to see a side of that city and state that they usually don’t see throughout the dregs of the regular season.Lastly, it’s a show. All-Star Weekend is meant to be entertainment that shows the fans a good time and that includes fans far beyond where the weekend is hosted.So was this a successful All-Star Weekend? Was basketball celebrated properly? Was the host city celebrated and given its due? Did the fans get a good show?In short, yes.

Ryan Sun, Deseret News 119 of 119 Celebrating basketball For the most indoctrinated hoops junkie (me) anytime a basketball touches the court is a celebration. Basketball is poetry personified and is as brutal as a fight but as graceful as a ballet. Basketball incorporates skill and focus and talent, but also leaves room for humor and family, joy and fun.The first celebration we need to think about when it comes to All-Star Weekend is the All-Stars themselves. The players that embody all of those poetic qualities on the court. Sure, there are some players who become jaded, who don’t want the attention, or who maybe lose their appreciation over time. But for first-time All-Stars and for those who still have a deep love of the game, you can see on their faces how much this weekend means to them. Related Photo gallery: Get a look at Salt Lake City’s All-Star Weekend LeBron James is a 19-time All-Star, the NBA’s all-time leading scorer and one of the greatest basketball players of all time and still, when he was introduced on Sunday night, a smile spread across his face as the crowd cheered.Giannis Antetokounmpo, a two-time MVP and seven-time All-Star, is nursing an injured wrist. He had absolutely no obligation to even step foot on the court on Sunday night or show up for the Skills Challenge on Saturday.\\xa0But he was there, supporting his brothers, laughing, taking pictures, letting his young children run on the court. He played just 20 seconds in the All-Star Game, quickly getting in a dunk before intentionally fouling so that he could exit the game. He didn’t have to be out there, but was happy to be.Jazz forward Lauri Markkanen paid for an entire suite so that his wife and children could celebrate Sunday night with a whole host of family and friends that Markkanen flew in from Finland. If the All-Star Game weren’t special, if it wasn’t something that mattered to players, they wouldn’t go through all the trouble.Making sure that the All-Stars are celebrated properly and that they enjoy themselves throughout the weekend is a huge part of the whole All-Star experience.The NBA and Utah not only celebrated the current All-Stars, but also paid homage to the All-Stars of yesteryear and to NBA legends no longer with us.At Vivint Arena on Sunday night, LeBron James, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Karl Malone, the top-3 all-time leader scorers were honored. Dan Roberts, who has been the PA announcer for the Jazz for 44 years was honored. Pau Gasol was honored for his work as an advocate for the WNBA and women’s and girl’s basketball.Basketball was celebrated from beginning to end in Utah and deservedly so.Celebrating Utah You might have heard that Charles Barkley and Shaquille O’Neal were making fun of Utah during Sunday’s broadcast, and that’s probably going to really rub people the wrong way. But the opinions of those ultra-rich guys who aren’t going to ever go out of their way to spend time in Utah should not be the opinions you pay attention to.I can’t even count how many NBA reporters, television analysts, visiting fans from other cities and countries commented on the beauty of Salt Lake and Utah. On multiple occasions people told me how much they enjoyed the food, people told me they were staying past the weekend to go visit the national parks, people said that they wanted to come back to see more.Those are the opinions that matter. Certainly there was a push to entice corporations and tech companies and rich people to invest and see Utah in a different light, one that would make them want to bring their business here. But those aren’t really the opinions or decisions that matter to me and I don’t think I’m alone on that.There was a ton of money raised for charity on behalf of NBA players, there were food banks that saw an increase in donations because of the NBA’s presence, there were local businesses that were visited more, there were restaurants that were booked solid, which meant there were restaurant workers who were able to work more and make more.There was a lot of good done over this weekend and there are a lot of people who are coming away with a positive impression from their time in Utah. So who cares what Shaq thinks. Utah Jazz forward Lauri Markkanen stands behind the 2023 All-Star trophy during the NBA All-Star game at Vivint Arena in Salt Lake City on Feb. 19, 2023.

There were incredible dunks, huge highlight plays, celebrity appearances and an incredible all-Nigerian halftime show featuring Burna Boy, Rema and Tems.Jayson Tatum and Boston Celtics teammate Jaylen Brown ended up dueling each other for portions of the All-Star Game before Tatum went on to break the all-time All-Star scoring record, finishing with 55 on the night.I understand that there are people who are very mad about the price of some of these events, especially All-Star Saturday night and the All-Star Game. There are definitely reasons to be mad about regular fans being priced out of these events.But, I also heard from a lot of fans who attended some of the more affordable events and had a ton of fun over the weekend. From the NBA Crossover event, to the All-Star practice and Rising Stars Tournament, as well as the HBCU Classic and G League Next Up Game, fans showed out for just about everything.

Ryan Sun, Deseret News 22 of 22 The more stories I heard from fans the more I thought about what Kenny ‘The Jet’ Smith said on Thursday when he was interviewed by local reporters.“It’s just walking trading cards in Utah right now,” Smith said.Fans ran into celebrities and NBA superstars out and about in Salt Lake City, at different events, on the concourse at the arena and were able to interact with them in a way that they normally wouldn’t be able to. Related ‘The real deal’: How Lauri Markkanen found his footing among the NBA’s elite All-Star Weekend: Walker Kessler’s Rising Stars moment goes by in a flash And we have to remember that this isn’t just about the local angle. All-Star Weekend is a global event. Markkanen said that even his family in Finland would watch the All-Star Game when he was growing up.A total of 73 international broadcast partners televised the All-Star festivities this year reaching fans in 214 countries. People from all over the world were able to tune in. So yeah, the NBA put on a good show.\\xa0Nothing is perfect The thing is, to fully embrace and celebrate something means acknowledging, the good and the bad, the perfections and the flaws.Through the weekend, the NBA and those who love it had to face some hard truths.There was a lot of controversy surrounding Malone and how much he was celebrated over the weekend considering his troubled past which has garnered more attention since his playing days.There were many who questioned why more Jazz greats weren’t a part of the main event festivities and were left without answers to those questions.Outside Vivint Arena on Sunday, protesters gathered to voice concerns over how the city handled the unsheltered people of Salt Lake, especially leading up to the All-Star Game.As stated above, many fans come away from All-Star Weekend feeling like the city was taken over and that it just ended up being an event for rich people, with prices to the headlining events costing more than some people’s rent.

Scott G Winterton, Deseret News 16 of 16 In his annual address Adam Silver said that All-Star Weekend would have an economic impact of nearly $280 million in Utah. Those aren’t numbers that I can confirm and I don’t even know how you calculate something like that beyond hotel and transportation costs. But, does the potential economic impact outweigh the potentially damaging or controversial parts of the weekend? I’m not really sure.I think that the best thing we can do when trying to decide if the All-Star Weekend hosted in Utah was a success, is look at the whole picture. We should make note of the ugly parts, admit the flaws and own up to what can be done better, while appreciating all of the things that were done well.',\n",

It’s just funny how those things work,” Mitchell said.“I’ve known Lauri for a while. It’s great to see him out here thriving, and it was great to have that moment, for sure.”Markkanen splashed his only 3 of the night a play later.

Scott G Winterton, Deseret News 17 of 17 The best sequence of the night for the Finland native came in the middle of second quarter, when he finished an alley-oop from Pascal Siakam, then threw down a reverse clutch jam for his 11th point of the night.After that series, touches were limited for Markkanen, shooting the ball just six times the rest of the game, making one — a hammer dunk to get Team Giannis six points away from the target score in the fourth quarter.Needing one point to win the game due to the target score ending, Markkanen was set up for a hometown hero moment, but his corner 3 missed.“I was thinking if I should go dunk it or shoot a 3. Joel was trying to get me in the paint and go dunk it. That’s why it took so long so shoot that 3. It would have been cool to knock that one down, but we got the job done, too,” Markkanen saidAnother local product, Lillard, got the rebound and nailed a 3 to win the game. Related Giannis Antetokounmpo, Donovan Mitchell praise Lauri Markkanen as he readies for first All-Star Game The evolution of Lauri Markkanen Markkanen was selected last among the starters in his first All-Star Game. The reserves were picked first, then the starters, and it came down to two-time MVP Nikola Jokic and Markkanen.Jokic appereared to take matters into his own hands, walking over to join Team LeBron, leaving Markkanen as the final selection, but after the game, Jokic clarified that he thought he was the last person remaining, so he walked over to join LeBron’s squad.“I mean, I’m just glad to be a part of this whole experience. I didn’t really care,” Markkanen said about being picked last.Then he joked with Jokic, who was also in the interview room.“He thought he was the last pick, so that’s why he stood up so early and made me look even worse. I blame it on him,” Markkanen said.All in all, it was a successful first All-Star Game for Markkanen.“It’s just a great experience to be a part of, and I can’t wait to be here again,” he said. “Pretty surreal. I was excited to get out there ... I was just happy to get out there and play with those guys.” — Utah Jazz forward Lauri Markkanen Jayson Tatum set an All-Star Game scoring record, pouring in 55 points while playing 35 minutes.The most entertaining part of the night was a one-on-one battle between Boston Celtics teammates Tatum and Jaylen Brown that featured actual defense and went on for multiple possessions.Mitchell gunned for MVP honors, scoring 40 points on his old floor, and Lillard made several long-range 3s and the game-winner, scoring 26.Denver Nuggets coach Michael Malone — who coached Team LeBron — called the contest the “worst basketball game ever played.”Yep, the All-Star Game is a lot different than the last time it was here in Salt Lake in 1993. Jayson Tatum of the Boston Celtics catches an alley-oop pass for a dunk during the NBA All-Star Game in Salt Lake City at Vivint Arena on Sunday, Feb. 19, 2023. Tatum was named the MVP.

Ryan Sun, Deseret News 119 of 119 A competitive game with lockdown defense, it was not. But take it for what it was, an entertaining basketball spectacle featuring plenty of long-distance 3s and dunks from the world’s best players, delighting the Utah crowd.The All-Star Game was missing a few stars — Golden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry, New Orleans Pelicans forward Zion Williamson and Phoenix Suns forward Kevin Durant were voted All-Star starters, but missed the All-Star Game due to injuries. Antetokounmpo, who was a major part of All-Star Weekend — appearing at nearly every event — was injured in the game just before the All-Star break, and played just 20 seconds, getting in a dunk before exiting.James didn’t return to the game after halftime after he got his finger caught in the rim during the game on a chase-down block.“I tried to get one little chase-down block, and got my finger caught in the rim. But I’ll be fine. I’ll be fine. I don’t think it’s too much to worry about. For precautionary reasons, I just had to take the rest of the night off,” James said.In the minutes he did play, James electrified the crowd, showing off from deep range and hammering dunks.James, the league’s new all-time leading scorer, was honored at halftime in a ceremony that featured Los Angeles Lakers center Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Utah Jazz forward Karl Malone — the NBA’s No. 2 and No. 3 spots on the all-time scoring list. Malone was joined by Hall of Fame point guard John Stockton courtside on Sunday.For one weekend, Utah was the center of the NBA world, playing host to the league’s best — and tens of thousands of visitors around the world.Let’s do it again in another 30 years — or sooner.',\n",
