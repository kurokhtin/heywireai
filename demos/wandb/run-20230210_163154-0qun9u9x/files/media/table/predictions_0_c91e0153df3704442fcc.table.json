Bass'\r\noffice can be reached at press@karenbass.com.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 By ERIC HE\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 City News Service\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 LOS ANGELES (CNS) - Karen Bass was sworn in as the 43rd mayor of Los\r\nAngeles today in a historic inauguration at the Microsoft Theater, becoming the\r\nfirst woman and second Black person to lead the city.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Bass was sworn in by Vice President Kamala Harris, a former California\r\nsenator and the first woman to serve as the nation's second-in-command.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Nearly every major city official, along with Gov. Gavin Newsom,\r\nattended the ceremony.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 ``Making history with each of you today is a monumental moment in my\r\nlife and for Los Angeles,'' Bass said in her speech.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Bass addressed what she described as an ``inflection point in our\r\nhistory,'' with issues including ``the pandemic, the rapidly changing economy,\r\nthe rapidly changing climate, the cost of living, (and) 40,000 people sleeping\r\non the street.''\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 ``I believe that times of inflection require reflection -- I believe,\r\nit's time for Angelenos to remind ourselves where we come from and who we\r\nare,'' she said.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Bass scheduled a news conference at 9 a.m. Monday to declare a state\r\nof emergency on homelessness as her first act as mayor. Her reference to that\r\naction drew a standing ovation. The emergency declaration will ``recognize the\r\nseverity of our crisis and break new ground to maximize our ability to urgently\r\nmove people inside, and do so for good.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 ``It will create the structure necessary for us to have a true,\r\nunified and citywide strategy to set us on the path to solve homelessness,''\r\nBass said.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Bass' plan also includes housing 17,000 homeless people in her first\r\nyear. She said Los Angeles has earned the ``shameful crown'' of having some of\r\nthe most overcrowded neighborhoods in the country and called for residents to\r\n``welcome housing to every neighborhood.''\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 ``We know our mission: We must build housing in every neighborhood,''\r\nBass said. ``We cannot continue to overcrowd neighborhoods that are already\r\novercrowded.''\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 On crime, Bass sought a strategy to make neighborhoods safe ``that is\r\ninformed by our communities,'' which includes launching an Office of Community\r\nSafety.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 ``Of course, we must stop crimes in progress and hold people\r\naccountable,'' Bass said. ``Some neighborhoods have asked for additional\r\nofficers, and we will deliver. But what neighborhoods are asking for and what\r\nthey need is as diverse as our city.''\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Sunday's ceremony was initially scheduled to take place outside City\r\nHall, but rain in the forecast led to a venue shift indoors. Instead, Bass was\r\nsworn in on the theater's stage, with two large ``LA'' letters in the mold of\r\nthe LAX sign to her right and a picture of the Spring Street City Hall steps\r\nbehind the stage.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 ``In our city's 241-year history, we've never witnessed a day like\r\ntoday as Los Angeles came together to celebrate the swearing in of Mayor Karen\r\nBass,'' said Mark Gonzalez, chair of the Los Angeles County Democratic Party,\r\nin a statement.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Surprise performers at the inauguration included Stevie Wonder, who\r\nsang ``Keep Our Love Alive'' and ``Living for the City,'' and Chloe Bailey and\r\nLas Cafeteras. Amanda Gorman, the first National Youth Poet Laureate, who also\r\ndelivered a poem at President Joe Biden's inauguration, said in her reading\r\nSunday that ``the time of never before is officially past.''\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 ``For where there's will, there's women,'' Gorman said. ``And where\r\nthere's women, there's forever a way.''\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Sunday's event marked the first mayoral inauguration in Los Angeles in\r\nnearly a decade, with outgoing mayor Eric Garcetti holding the post since 2013.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Bass defeated developer Rick Caruso on Nov. 8 in an expensive and at-\r\ntimes contentious race.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 She will inherit leadership of a city grappling with a scandal that\r\nhas embroiled City Hall for the past two months, after three council members\r\nand a top county labor official took part in a recorded conversation in October\r\n2021 that included racist comments and attempts to manipulate redistricting.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 The fallout has continued to roil City Hall, with Councilman Kevin de\r\nLe\u00f3n -- one of the participants in the conversation -- unexpectedly returning\r\nto the chamber on Friday, setting off chaos as he continues to defy calls to\r\nresign. De Le\u00f3n later fought with an activist at a holiday tree lighting event\r\non Friday evening.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 City Council President Paul Krekorian, who swore in five new city\r\ncouncil members and a new city attorney and city controller at Sunday's\r\nceremony, said that there is no leader more capable of bringing the city\r\ntogether than Bass.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 ``This is a time of unprecedented challenges in our city, but today as\r\nI look out at this audience and see the people with us, I know that this is\r\nalso a time of unprecedented opportunity,'' Krekorian said.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Krekorian added that Bass will have a ``very strong part in the Los\r\nAngeles City Council,'' a positive sign for Bass -- who will need to have the\r\ncouncil renew her state of emergency for homelessness every month.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Bass, 69, grew up in the midst of the civil rights movement with three\r\nbrothers in the Venice and Fairfax neighborhoods. She was drawn to\r\ncommunity activism after watching the movement on television, volunteering for\r\nRobert F. Kennedy's 1968 presidential campaign when she was 14. Bass said while\r\nher parents did not live to see her take elected office, ``their love, support\r\nand guidance is why I stand before you today.''\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Bass' father fled the Jim Crow south during the great African American\r\nmigration after World War II and found work as a letter carrier. His\r\npaycheck supported Bass and her siblings, and allowed her mother to choose to\r\nbe a homemaker.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 ``When I think about the dreams of working people today, I reflect on\r\nthe fact that my mother and father were able to buy a home in Los Angeles for\r\ntheir family of six with one paycheck,'' Bass said.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Bass' organizing career began in 1990 when she founded Community\r\nCoalition, a South Los Angeles social justice group in response to the crack\r\ncocaine crisis. In 2004, Bass was the only Black woman in the state Legislature\r\nwhen she was elected to the Assembly. Four years later, she became the first\r\nBlack woman to lead the chamber. Bass was elected to the U.S. House of\r\nRepresentatives in 2010 and chaired the Congressional Black Caucus in 2019 and\r\n2020.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 State Senate President pro-Tempore Toni Atkins said that Bass didn't\r\nrun for mayor for ``credit or photo-opps.''\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 ``She is here to work,'' Atkins said. ``She is here because she loves\r\nthis city, she loves its people. She is here to answer the call to serve. And\r\nthat is who she is.''\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 The new mayor called for the city to focus on solutions rather than\r\njurisdiction, to link arms rather than point fingers.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 ``If we just focus on bringing people inside, comprehensively\r\naddressing their needs, and moving them to permanent housing with a way to pay\r\ntheir bills, we will save lives and save our city,'' Bass said. ``That is my\r\nmission as your mayor.''\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Bass said her father taught her to be a critical thinker, and to\r\nunderstand the historical context of national and international events.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 ``My daily conversations with him led me to make a lifetime commitment\r\nto do whatever I can to change the world,'' she said.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Through the ``unaffordability, the difficulty, the struggle working\r\npeople face today in Los Angeles,'' Bass said that Angelenos have ``never, ever\r\ngiven up.''\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 ``And our magic, L.A. magic, it's still here,'' she said.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Copyright 2022, City News Service, Inc.\n\r\nCNS-12-11-2022 20:50", "Generate a story that involves the following entities and origin example:\n- Bass Inauguration: PERSON\n- 12: CARDINAL\n- 8:50 PM: TIME\n- 3rd: ORDINAL\n- Hold News Conference\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Eds: ORG\n- Bass: PERSON\n- 7th: ORDINAL\n- Bass: PERSON\n- ERIC HE\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 City News Service: PERSON\n- LOS ANGELES: GPE\n- CNS: ORG\n- Karen Bass: PERSON\n- 43rd: ORDINAL\n- Los\r\nAngeles: GPE\n- today: DATE\n- the Microsoft Theater: ORG\n- first: ORDINAL\n- second: ORDINAL\n- Bass: PERSON\n- Kamala Harris: PERSON\n- California: GPE\n- first: ORDINAL\n- second: ORDINAL\n- Gavin Newsom: PERSON\n- today: DATE\n- Los Angeles: GPE\n- Bass: PERSON\n- Bass: PERSON\n- 40,000: CARDINAL\n- Angelenos: PERSON\n- Bass: PERSON\n- 9 a.m.: TIME\n- Monday: DATE\n- first: ORDINAL\n- Bass: PERSON\n- Bass: PERSON\n- 17,000: CARDINAL\n- her first\r\nyear: DATE\n- Los Angeles: GPE\n- Bass: PERSON\n- Bass: PERSON\n- an Office of Community\r\nSafety: ORG\n- Bass: PERSON\n- Sunday: DATE\n- City\r\nHall: FAC\n- Bass: PERSON\n- two: CARDINAL\n- LA: GPE\n- LAX: ORG\n- 241-year: DATE\n- a day: DATE\n- today: DATE\n- Los Angeles: GPE\n- Bass: PERSON\n- Mark Gonzalez: PERSON\n- the Los Angeles County Democratic Party: ORG\n- Stevie Wonder: PERSON\n- Keep Our Love: WORK_OF_ART\n- Living for the City: WORK_OF_ART\n- Chloe Bailey: PERSON\n- Las Cafeteras: ORG\n- Amanda Gorman: PERSON\n- first: ORDINAL\n- Joe Biden's: PERSON\n- Sunday: DATE\n- Gorman: PERSON\n- Sunday: DATE\n- first: ORDINAL\n- Los Angeles: GPE\n- nearly a decade: DATE\n- Eric Garcetti: PERSON\n- 2013: DATE\n- Bass: PERSON\n- Rick Caruso: PERSON\n- Nov. 8: DATE\n- City Hall: FAC\n- the past two months: DATE\n- three: CARDINAL\n- October\r\n2021: DATE\n- City Hall: FAC\n- Councilman Kevin de\r\nLe\u00f3n: PERSON\n- Friday: DATE\n- De Le\u00f3n: PERSON\n- Friday: DATE\n- evening: TIME\n- City Council: ORG\n- Paul Krekorian: PERSON\n- five: CARDINAL\n- new city: GPE\n- Sunday: DATE\n- Bass: PERSON\n- today: DATE\n- Krekorian: PERSON\n- Krekorian: PERSON\n- Bass: PERSON\n- the Los\r\nAngeles City Council: ORG\n- Bass: PERSON\n- every month: DATE\n- Bass: PERSON\n- 69: DATE\n- three: CARDINAL\n- Venice: GPE\n- Fairfax: GPE\n- Robert F.
