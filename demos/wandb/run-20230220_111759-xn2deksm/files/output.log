 Kardin Bass, the first female mayor of Los Angeles and the 43rd mayor in the city's history, was ushered into office in a historic and spectacular inauguration ceremony at the Microsoft Theater on Sunday. Vice President Kamala Harris officiated the ceremony, which was attended by outstanding public figures such as California Governor Gavin Newsom, Council President Paul Krekorian and Toni Atkins, the State Senate President. Amanda Gorman, Chloe Bailey, and Las Cafeteras had a surprise performance at the event.
Bass had a long-running career of community service since she began working in the medical field. She used her influence to garner support from the local and nearby offices of community safety and has been highly praised by Councilman Kevin De León. She also worked in the Los Angeles County Democratic Party for nearly a decade and served as a Councilwoman for the Los Angeles City Council for twelve years. She worked in California's legislature for five years before dedicating four years of service in the U.S. House of Representatives in 2013. For the past four years, she was a Congresswoman from Los Angeles County. Shortly before her election as the mayor, Bass was being considered as Joe Biden's running mate, with speculation that she was a top contender for Vice President.
While Bass was thanked and praised for her years of service and community contributions, Rick Caruso received a wave of criticism. Caruso, who spent $100 million on his campaign, expressed his disappointment in the election results and the voters' choice in favour of Bass. During her address, Bass declared an emergency on homelessness in Los Angeles with a pledge to house 17,000 people in her first year in office. She laid out solutions to make neighborhoods stay safe, expand housing availability and stated that housing should be available in every neighborhood. Furthermore, Bass has been called a leader that the city of Los Angeles needed to bring people together during this time of turmoil and hope.
Bass' election marked an impressive milestone for African Americans in the United States as four of the five largest cities in America now have Black mayors. This came nearly 241 years after Los Angeles was first founded in the late 18th century, nearly a century after the African Americans endured the Jim Crow era in the South and nearly five decades after the Congressional Black Caucus was founded in 1969.
On Monday, the day after Bass' inauguration, her team held a press conference to discuss her new plans to serve Los Angeles city hall. These plans include Bass keeping her vow to improve neighborhoods, giving more resources to law enforcement and expanding economic development opportunities. Her organization will host events in the city of Los Angeles every month to unite and inform the Angelinos on current developments and policies.
Furthermore, three of Bass' colleagues in the Los Angeles City Council—Mark Gonzalez, Eric Garcetti and Paul Krekorian—join the mayor in the city hall's westside room at 9 a.m. to hold a news conference in the City News Service. They are accompanied by the Los Angeles County Democratic Party's chair, Eric He. Here, the four lauded and praised the Bass inauguration and for claiming the mayorship seat. They each expressed their admiration for Bass and enthusiasm for her reining over the city. Furthermore, the press conference served as a call to action, pointing out the critical and current issues such as World War II homelessness, the re-emergence of coronavirus cases, and the need for bold and effective solutions and collaboration.
The "Keep Our Love" initiative will conclude on October 2021, the four-year anniversary of Bass' inauguration. She is organizing a surprise performance and gathering at the Microsoft Theater on Friday evening. Although the performers remain a mystery even to the council members and the press, the media has speculated that Stevie Wonder, Chloe Bailey, Amanda Gorman and Las Cafeteras will be present.  Moreover, the mayor will deliver a speech encouraging Angelenos to keep love in their hearts and minds, and re-emphasize the importance of a secure and inclusive future for all.
The Bass Inauguration marks the second chapter of her mayoral election and the beginning of a rebuilding period for Los Angeles. She has vowed to double the number of people housed in Los Angeles from 40,000 to 80,000 by 2022. Although Bass has only now been inaugurated into office, her team has been actively working towards tackling pressing issues and restoring hope in Los Angeles. With the leadership of Mayor Bass, Los Angeles is projected to benefit from more secure housing and more safe neighborhoods.

On Sunday, Nov. 8, as the sun set, Los Angeles came together to herald an astonishing moment in history. At 8:50 pm, Karen Bass was sworn in as the 43rd mayor of the City of Angels, the first female mayor in the 241-year history of the city, and the second African American mayor.
For many, Bass' victory represents a new era in the city's political climate. Since 1990, when Bass founded Community Coalition, she has dedicated her professional career to improving Los Angeles. She won recognition for her efforts to blend city government and citizen involvement. Bass started her political career in the Assembly and eventually made her way to Congress where she became a member of the Congressional Black Caucus. In the House of Representatives, Bass championed the Keeping Our Love alive Act to provide housing for 40,000 people experiencing homelessness in LA.
The momentous occasion took place at the Microsoft Theater and there was an impressive guest list, including Vice President Kamala Harris, Governor Gavin Newsom and LA Democratic Party Chairman Mark Gonzalez. In 2019, Bass also enlisted the help of then-California State Senate President pro tempore Toni Atkins, a long-time ally who has been with Bass since their days in the legislature and the Assembly.
In the lead up to the event, the City of Angeles released a video, "Living for the City", reflecting on Bass' work and celebrating the new mayor's journey. Performers included musicians Stevie Wonder and Chloe Bailey, and youngest National Youth Poet Laureate Amanda Gorman, praised by Vice President Harris for showing that "L.A. is alive".
In her inaugural address, Bass spoke of challenging times as the city faces historic levels of homelessness and the upcoming economic recovery from the pandemic. Despite the difficulties, Bass promised "an inflection point in our history" and outlined her plan to house 17,000 people in her first year as mayor. She will also create an Office of Community Safety and make housing available in each neighborhood.
To conclude her address, Bass highlighted the importance of unity and solidarity to improve the city. She thanked her parents for their guidance and love and reminded Angelenos of the "L.A. Magic" that persists.
However, Bass leadership is being contested by her primary opponent, billionaire developer Rick Caruso, who spent more than $100 million on the most expensive campaign in Los Angeles history. On Friday, Councilman Kevin de León had planned to hold a news conference to publicly endorse Bass for mayor, but held it off until her inauguration. Now that she has officially taken office, de León believes Bass is the leader the city of Los Angeles needs to bring people together.
The swearing-in ceremony was historic and marked the beginning of a new chapter in Los Angeles' history. Despite Bass' daunting tasks, her community involvement and solution-driven mentality are sure to be valuable assets. As the four largest cities in the US all now have Black mayors, the future of Los Angeles looks incredibly bright.
