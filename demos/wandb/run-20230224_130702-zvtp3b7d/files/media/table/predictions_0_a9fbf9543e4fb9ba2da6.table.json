The story should involves the following entities and original example. Please make sure the story you generate is at least 500 words long.\nOriginal example: Headband Harden recorded 31 points, 6 threes, 7 rebounds and 7 assists in a Sixers comeback win against the Grizzlies, who are currently 2nd in the Western Conference. Harden's performance marked his fourth game of the season with 30+ points. If this is potentially the James Harden that we'll see in the playoffs, then the Sixers should start getting sized for rings ASAP. Diving for loose balls, draining threes over an entire starting lineup, and even getting chippy with Dillon Brooks. Side note: I've decided that Dillon Brooks is a dickhead who would be a fantastic Waffle House manager if he wasn't decent at basketball. Anyways, if I wasn't a Sixers fan, I would be calling up the NBA front office to get Harden's headband tested for PEDs. Instead of heading home and calling it a night, he allegedly went into the bathroom and came out with the infamous white band around his noggin. Apparently he proceeded to throw nearly $4 million in one dollar bills and raged on for the next week and a half.Philadelphia 76ers star Joel Embiid took five steps off the charity stripe and looked down at the floor after missing a free throw. The Grizzlies were flying around, and Jaren Jackson Jr. , a front-runner for NBA Defensive Player of the Year, played roamer and helped aggressively off of P.J. The first was the opponent: Memphis, led by Ja Morant 's downhill attacks, leads the NBA in points in the paint. It was as if the basketball gods rewarded Embiid's defensive intensity throughout the game with a highlight-reel block on Morant in crunchtime. Harden scored at a high level against an elite defense: 31 points on 10-of-16 shooting, 6 of 9 from beyond the arc and 5 of 7 from the free-throw line. That felt fitting on a night he passed Allen Iverson for 26th on the NBA's all-time scoring list. That's gonna prepare us for the postseason, so I thought it was good for us.\u201d Rivers had to work hard for the win as well. Harden tracked down the ball, hit the floor and found Embiid on an outlet pass for a fast-break dunk.The Sixers star has reached out to support student, John Hao -- a fan of Harden's -- who was paralyzed in the shooting James Harden's answer started fittingly Thursday night when he was asked about passing Allen Iverson on the NBA's all-time scoring list. I'm just happy to be in the same conversation as him, and I've got a long way to go.\u201d Harden scored 31 against Memphis and was easily the Sixers' top offensive player on a night where Joel Embiid played tremendous defense but had serious shooting woes. The Sixers have won 16 of their last 20 games heading into a matchup Saturday night against the top-seeded Celtics. We don't want to put ourselves in that situation where we're down double-digit points for basically the entire game. That's always a good sign.\u201d Harden also didn't mind putting aside the specifics of Thursday's game to reflect on another topic. As ESPN's Malika Andrews detailed , Harden recently spoke on FaceTime with John Hao, a Michigan State student. So a couple of people from my team flew up there, were actually in the hospital with him, and brought him some things to kind of cheer him up, make him smile. \u2026 I gave him my number so whenever he feels like he needs anything, he can call me and I can check up on him.\u201d While Harden and Iverson are obviously different in plenty of ways, the Sixers' 33-year point guard recognizes that his stardom can be similarly powerful outside of basketball.\n Entities: - Tyrese Maxey: Human\n- USA: Country\n- AI: Location\n- Celtics: Organization\n- Paul Reed: Human\n- Sixers: Nonprofit_organization\n- Memphis: Community\n- NBA: Organization\n- Allen Iverson: Human\n- Atlanta: Company\n- Michigan State: Location\n- Philadelphia: Community\n- Embiid: Human\n- Ja Morant: Human\n- ESPN: Product_(business)\n- Jaren Jackson Jr.: Human\n- Things: Organization\n- Tobias Harris: Human\n- Grizzlies: Nonprofit_organization\n- James: Human\n- Doc Rivers: Human\n- Joel: Human\n- FaceTime: Product_(business)\n- Malika Andrews: Human\n- Memphis: Location\n- Miami: Company\n- Waffle House: Product_(business)\n- Dillon Brooks: Human\n- \u2014 Malika Andrews: Human\n- John Hao: Human\n- Sixers: Organization\n- Memphis Grizzlies: Organization\n- James Harden: Human\n- Western Conference: Location\n- Bill Russell: Human\n- Wells Fargo: Financial_institution\n- Hao: Location\n- Philadelphia: Company\n- Joel Embiid: Human\n- @malika_andrews: Organization\n- Tucker: Human\n- Coincidence: Organization\n- Donning: Organization\n- Harden: Human\n- Grizzlies: Organization\n- De'Anthony Melton: Human\n- NBA: Nonprofit_organization\n- Harden-Embiid: Organization\n- Headband Harden: Human\n- Maxey: Community\n- Philly: Location\n- Sam Hinkie: Human\n\nBegin story:", {"prompt_tokens": 1169, "completion_tokens": 656, "total_tokens": 1825}, "\n\nJames Harden: Headband Prodigy\n\nIt was a game for the ages. The Philadelphia 76ers were facing off against the Memphis Grizzlies, the team who are currently second in the Western Conference and boast one of the NBA's most powerful rosters. The Sixers needed something special from their star player, James Harden, if they were to come out triumphant - and boy, did he deliver.\n\nHarden, who had swapped his signature glasses and signature headband, scored 31 points, with 6 of those being three pointers, as well as 7 rebounds and 7 assists. It was his fourth game of the season with 30 or more points, and it showed the Sixers they might have something special on their hands. As NBA analyst Malika Andrews put it, the basketball gods rewarded Embiid's defensive intensity throughout the game with a highlight-reel block on Morant in crunchtime.\n\nThe Sixers were flying around and it seemed as though everybody had a hand in the victory. Ja Morant seemed unstoppable as he pushed the Grizzlies forwards, with Jaren Jackson Jr., one of front-runners for the Defensive Player of the Year award, playing a major role. Joel Embiid had an incredible night, missing a few free throws, but rebounding with a brace of highlight reel blocks on Morant, the last of which paved the way for Harden's game-winning shot from beyond the arc.\n\nHarden had faced up to the elite Memphis defense and come through with flying colors, becoming only the 26th player in the NBA's all-time scoring list - an impressive feat which he humbly admitted should not be compared with the legendary Allen Iverson. He also performed it with a certain level of showmanship, opting to take to the court sporting the infamous white band around his head.\n\nHowever, this proved to be a mere sideshow. Following the match, with the Sixers already having won the game, Harden reached out to a fan in Michigan State. John Hao, a student and a major admirer of Harden's, had recently been paralyzed during a shooting in his hometown. To show his support, Harden organized for people from his team to visit John in the hospital, bringing with them gifts to cheer him up and give him something to smile about. He even gave Hao his own cellphone number, so that he could ask for help if he needed it.\n\nHarden's kind-hearted gesture has been emblematic of his form as of late, leading the Sixers to 16 wins in their last 20 games, with their next battle being against the conference-leading Celtics. He is the heart of the Sixers, with his form indicative of the team's current level of optimism, something which Joel Embiid echoed when he said \u201cThat's gonna prepare us for the postseason, so I thought it was good for us.\u201d\n\nThis could be the start of an exciting new era for the Sixers, one which sees them dominating the NBA for many years to come, as well as one which sees an underrated star position himself as one of the sport's most powerful figures. If Headband Harden can continue his impressive recent form, then the Sixers should indeed be preparing for something very special."]]}
