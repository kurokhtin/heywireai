The huge property boasted of breathtaking views and state-of-the-art amenities, and was the talk of the town. The property was recently featured in the Robb Report and earned the Michelin rating for its sheer elegance and attention to detail.\n\nThe home belonged to the Salgado family, who had built the house from scratch. Rachel Salgado, the matriarch of the family, had an impeccable taste and an eye for detail. She had ensured that every aspect of the house exuded luxury and comfort. The family had decided to sell the property and move to a French chateau built by renowned architect Bassett.\n\nThe Salgado family had enlisted the help of Emma Reynolds, a popular real estate agent from Williams & Williams, who had previously represented clients in the Beverly Hills Estates and the French Riviera. Her team had created a beautiful newsletter with stunning pictures and a detailed description of the property, which immediately caught the attention of potential buyers.\n\nOne of the interested buyers was Ben Simmons, a well-known NBA player for the Brooklyn Nets. Simmons had recently signed a lucrative contract and was looking for a luxurious property that would be a perfect retreat after long basketball practices. He had come across the Martinsville property on Facebook and had subsequently followed up on Twitter and Instagram.\n\nReynolds had arranged for a tour of the property and was accompanied by Greg LaPlant, a local photographer who had previously worked with Rich Home Designs. LaPlant was impressed with the property and felt that it would be a perfect backdrop for an All-Star photo shoot. He had brought along his newly purchased drone and had captured some breathtaking shots of the house.\n\nSimmons was accompanied by his agent, Max Nobel, who was equally impressed with the property's upscale features. They were particularly fascinated by the Pietra marble flooring, the Fleetwood sliding glass doors, and the Preciosa Lighting fixtures. The house had a contemporary design with a touch of California, which appealed to both Simmons and Nobel.\n\nAfter spending an hour in the property, Simmons had made up his mind and had decided to purchase the property. Reynolds had negotiated a fair price with the Salgado family, and the property had changed hands within a month. Simmons had then enlisted the help of Patrick Springs, a Southwestern Virginia-based interior designer, to decorate the property to his liking. Springs had created a beautiful loft area with a pool table and a home theater, which overlooked the living room.\n\nThe \u201cRare Gem\u201d property in Martinsville had become the talk of North Carolina, and the Martinsville Bulletin had featured an article on the sale of the property. The article had praised the property's privacy and spectacular views, and had highlighted the fact that it was a unique property that was rarely found in Central Illinois.\n\nSimmons had hosted a grand party in the property after the renovation, which was attended by several NBA players, including Joel Embiid and LeBron James. The renovations had given the property a new lease of life, and it had become a popular spot for photo shoots and events. The property had become a landmark in Martinsville, and people would often browse the pictures on social media and marvel at its sheer grandeur. The \u201cRare Gem\u201d property had become a prized possession for Simmons, and he knew that he had made the right decision by investing in it."]]}
