The six-term congresswoman, who currently represents South and West Los Angeles, defeated real estate developer Rick Caruso in the general election last month. During her campaign, Bass leaned into her experience bringing together Black and Latino community organizers in South Los Angeles in the early 1990s to address the root causes of crime and the crack epidemic. She was able to put together a winning coalition of Black voters in South Los Angeles and White progressives on the city\u2019s west side to help overcome Caruso\u2019s spending. The mayor-elect began her career as a physician assistant in the emergency room in Los Angeles County.The ceremony was initially scheduled to take place outside of City Hall, but due to the rain, was moved indoors. Ready to get down to business, Bass said she would spend her first day in office declaring a state of emergency on the homeless issue plaguing the city. \"I will start my first day as mayor at the city's emergency operations centers, where my first act as mayor will be to declare a state of emergency on homelessness,\" Bass said, noting that she will \"recognize the severity of our crisis and break new ground to maximize our ability to urgently move people inside, and do so for good.\" Dozens of prominent politicians were in attendance for the inauguration, including California State Senate President pro-tempore Toni Atkins, Los Angeles County Democratic Party Chairman Mark Gonzalez and Governor Gavin Newsom. Bass, 69, was a social worker and community activist before representing Los Angeles in the state Assembly for six years, where she also served as the first African American speaker. Council President Paul Krekorian spoke at the event, predicting that Bass is just the leader the city of Los Angeles needs to bring people together. He now awaits further plans pending his nomination to become U.S. ambassador to India, which has hit a snag due to opposition from some on Senate, concerned with sexual misconduct allegations against a former Garcetti staff member. Bass was named mayor-elect in November after a close race with her competitor Rick Caruso, the billionaire developer who spent more than $100 million on his campaign.\n Entities: - 69: DATE\n- 241-year: DATE\n- african american: NORP\n- 2022: DATE\n- city council: ORG\n- fairfax: GPE\n- daily: DATE\n- five: CARDINAL\n- bass: PERSON\n- first: ORDINAL\n- monday: DATE\n- la: GPE\n- six: CARDINAL\n- toni atkins: PERSON\n- city hall: FAC\n- robert f. kennedy's: PERSON\n- world war ii: EVENT\n- los angeles: GPE\n- the jim crow: ORG\n- one: CARDINAL\n- three: CARDINAL\n- nearly a decade: DATE\n- 17,000: CARDINAL\n- sunday: DATE\n- l.a.: GPE\n- 14: DATE\n- the congressional black caucus: ORG\n- 8:50 pm: TIME\n- nov. 8: DATE\n- chloe bailey: PERSON\n- living for the city: WORK_OF_ART\n- 1968: DATE\n- angelenos: PERSON\n- stevie wonder: PERSON\n- 2013: DATE\n- the u.s. house: ORG\n- 40,000: CARDINAL\n- every month: DATE\n- joe biden's: PERSON\n- cns: ORG\n- 9 a.m.: TIME\n- assembly: ORG\n- friday: DATE\n- her first\r\nyear: DATE\n- the los angeles county democratic party: ORG\n- two: CARDINAL\n- october\r\n2021: DATE\n- los\r\nangeles: GPE\n- today: DATE\n- de le\u00f3n: PERSON\n- krekorian: PERSON\n- city news service: ORG\n- evening: TIME\n- 3rd: ORDINAL\n- mark gonzalez: PERSON\n- rick caruso: PERSON\n- keep our love: WORK_OF_ART\n- atkins: PERSON\n- paul krekorian: PERSON\n- 2010: DATE\n- 7th: ORDINAL\n- lax: ORG\n- 1990: DATE\n- city\r\nhall: FAC\n- gorman: PERSON\n- 2019: DATE\n- a day: DATE\n- legislature: ORG\n- the los\r\nangeles city council: ORG\n- amanda gorman: PERSON\n- 12: CARDINAL\n- venice: GPE\n- eric he\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 city news service: PERSON\n- councilman kevin de\r\nle\u00f3n: PERSON\n- california: GPE\n- bass inauguration: PERSON\n- new city: GPE\n- an office of community\r\nsafety: ORG\n- hold news conference\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 eds: ORG\n- community\r\ncoalition: ORG\n- senate: ORG\n- gavin newsom: PERSON\n- eric garcetti: PERSON\n- four years later: DATE\n- second: ORDINAL\n- kamala harris: PERSON\n- the microsoft theater: ORG\n- 2004: DATE\n\nBegin story::", {"prompt_tokens": 1622, "completion_tokens": 664, "total_tokens": 2286}, "\nVice President Kamala Harris will swear in Karen Bass as the 43rd mayor of Los Angeles in an inauguration ceremony on Sunday, meeting two Democratic women who have broken barriers in politics.

The ceremony was initially scheduled to take place outside of City Hall, but was moved indoors due to the rain. Gorman said in her reading that \"the time of never before is officially past\" as dozens of prominent politicians, like California State Senate President pro-tempore Toni Atkins, LA County Democratic Party Chairman Mark Gonzalez and Governor Gavin Newsom, attended the inauguration.\n\nMartinez, a social worker and community activist, began her career as a physician assistant in the emergency room of Los Angeles County and served in the state assembly for six years, during which she was the first African American speaker of the house. In 1990, she founded Community Coalition, a South Los Angeles social justice group that sought to address the root causes of crime and the crack cocaine epidemic in response to the crisis.\n\nMartinez's father had earlier fled the Jim Crow south during the great African American migration following World War II and worked as a letter carrier. Her campaign during the mayoral election leaned into her experience of bringing together Black and Latino community organizers in South Los Angeles in the early 1990s. The inauguration followed her 2021 electoral victory over rival candidate and former LA City Councilman Paul Krekorian in November 8, 2019.\n\nDuring her inaugural speech, Martinez thanked all angelenos for their \"work towards creating a city where all of our children can thrive no matter what zip code they call home\". She also named prominent activists and visionaries, like Robert F. Kennedy's \"Children of the Dream\" speech of 1968 and Stevie Wonder's Living for the City, who are living legacies of hardworking communities.\n\nIn attendance of Martinez's swearing-in ceremony were over 17,000 residents, 80 members of the Congressional Black Caucus, and several household names, including professional dancers Chloe and Halle Bailey who perform the song Keep Our Love. Other attending guests included Los Angeles County Democratic Party chairman Mark Gonzalez and Rick Caruso, a businessman and Los Angeles Community College community member.\n\nThe inauguration ceremony was held at the Microsoft Theater and streamed live, where it was watched by over 175,000 viewers. The inaugural committee also distributed 3,500 tote bags with Martinez's slogan \"L.A. is Here\" printed on them. Martinez is the second Latinx mayor of Los Angeles and her first four year term, starting from 2021 to 2022, will see her make hard decisions with the City Council, who must manage the city's budget of nearly 40,000 every month.\n\nMartinez's inauguration also coincided with the nomination of Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti for the US Ambassador to India, a decision that has been met by opposition from some members of the Senate due to sexual misconduct allegations against a former Garcetti staff member."]]}
