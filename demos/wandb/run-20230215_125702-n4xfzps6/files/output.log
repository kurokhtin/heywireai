Vice President Kamala Harris will swear in Karen Bass as the 43rd mayor of Los Angeles in an inauguration ceremony on Sunday, meeting two Democratic women who have broken barriers in politics. The ceremony, which was slated to take place outdoors at City Hall, was moved indoors due to rain in the forecast. Numerous prominent politicians were in attendance, including California State Senate President pro-tempore Toni Atkins, Los Angeles County Democratic Party Chairman Mark Gonzalez, and Governor Gavin Newsom.
Bass, a 69 year old social worker, the first African-American woman to hold the office, garnered a considerable victory over billionaire developer Rick Caruso in the Nov. 8 general election. She promised to address the city's housing crisis, and declared her first official act as mayor to be a state of emergency on homelessness.
Originally beginning as a physician assistant at Los Angeles County in 1990, Bass founded Community Coalition, a South Los Angeles social justice group, in response to the crack cocaine epidemic. She entered the legislature in 2004 and became the first African-American woman to become Assembly Speaker in the seventh state in the nation three years later in 2008.
Prior to her mayoral campaign, Bass had served on the U.S. House for five years and the Congressional Black Caucus for nearly a decade. During her campaign, she leaned into her experience with uniting Black and Latino community organizers and procuring 17,000 volunteers — including thousands of new voters.
At the inauguration, Bass spoke about what the moment meant for her and the people of South Los Angeles. Her father had fled the Jim Crow south during the great African-American migration after World War II and found work as a letter carrier. Bass continued, “When I think about the dreams of working people today, I reflect on the fact that my mother and father were able to buy a home in Los Angeles for their family of six with one paycheck”.
Council President Paul Krekorian spoke at the event, predicting that Bass is just the leader the city of Los Angeles needs to bring people together. To commemorate the occasion, surprise performers included music virtuoso Stevie Wonder, Chloe Bailey and Las Cafeteras. National Youth Poet Laureate Amanda Gorman, who also delivered a poem at President Joe Biden's inauguration earlier this year, read her poem “The Time of Never Before is Officially Past.”
The ceremony marked a significant moment for Bass, who noted to reporters after winning her race that the gravity of becoming the first female mayor of Los Angeles was only beginning to sink in. “When you’re in a position like this – and I was in a similar position when I was sworn in as speaker – it means that you have extra responsibility. The path that you go is laying the foundation for those that come behind you.”
State Senate President pro-Tempore Toni Atkins spoke at the event, noting that Bass didn't run for mayor for "credit or photo-opps,” instead understanding the gravity of her role in developing the city of Los Angeles. Bass, who is expected to serve through 2022, is now held to the promise of treating the homelessness crisis while concurrently driving the economy of the city.

Amanda Gorman, the first National Youth Poet Laureate, shared her inspirational words during the inauguration of Los Angeles Mayor-elect, City Councilor, 69-year-old Nury Martinez on Sunday, November 14, 2021. The ceremony was initially scheduled to take place outside of City Hall, but was moved indoors due to the rain. Gorman said in her reading that "the time of never before is officially past" as dozens of prominent politicians, like California State Senate President pro-tempore Toni Atkins, LA County Democratic Party Chairman Mark Gonzalez and Governor Gavin Newsom, attended the inauguration.
Martinez, a social worker and community activist, began her career as a physician assistant in the emergency room of Los Angeles County and served in the state assembly for six years, during which she was the first African American speaker of the house. In 1990, she founded Community Coalition, a South Los Angeles social justice group that sought to address the root causes of crime and the crack cocaine epidemic in response to the crisis.
Martinez's father had earlier fled the Jim Crow south during the great African American migration following World War II and worked as a letter carrier. Her campaign during the mayoral election leaned into her experience of bringing together Black and Latino community organizers in South Los Angeles in the early 1990s. The inauguration followed her 2021 electoral victory over rival candidate and former LA City Councilman Paul Krekorian in November 8, 2019.
During her inaugural speech, Martinez thanked all angelenos for their "work towards creating a city where all of our children can thrive no matter what zip code they call home". She also named prominent activists and visionaries, like Robert F. Kennedy's "Children of the Dream" speech of 1968 and Stevie Wonder's Living for the City, who are living legacies of hardworking communities.
In attendance of Martinez's swearing-in ceremony were over 17,000 residents, 80 members of the Congressional Black Caucus, and several household names, including professional dancers Chloe and Halle Bailey who perform the song Keep Our Love. Other attending guests included Los Angeles County Democratic Party chairman Mark Gonzalez and Rick Caruso, a businessman and Los Angeles Community College community member.
The inauguration ceremony was held at the Microsoft Theater and streamed live, where it was watched by over 175,000 viewers. The inaugural committee also distributed 3,500 tote bags with Martinez's slogan "L.A. is Here" printed on them. Martinez is the second Latinx mayor of Los Angeles and her first four year term, starting from 2021 to 2022, will see her make hard decisions with the City Council, who must manage the city's budget of nearly 40,000 every month.
Martinez's inauguration also coincided with the nomination of Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti for the US Ambassador to India, a decision that has been met by opposition from some members of the Senate due to sexual misconduct allegations against a former Garcetti staff member.
