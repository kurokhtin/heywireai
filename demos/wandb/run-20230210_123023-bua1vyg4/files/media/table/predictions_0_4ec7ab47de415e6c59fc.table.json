Bass'\r\noffice can be reached at press@karenbass.com.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 By ERIC HE\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 City News Service\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 LOS ANGELES (CNS) - Karen Bass was sworn in as the 43rd mayor of Los\r\nAngeles today in a historic inauguration at the Microsoft Theater, becoming the\r\nfirst woman and second Black person to lead the city.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Bass was sworn in by Vice President Kamala Harris, a former California\r\nsenator and the first woman to serve as the nation's second-in-command.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Nearly every major city official, along with Gov. Gavin Newsom,\r\nattended the ceremony.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 ``Making history with each of you today is a monumental moment in my\r\nlife and for Los Angeles,'' Bass said in her speech.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Bass addressed what she described as an ``inflection point in our\r\nhistory,'' with issues including ``the pandemic, the rapidly changing economy,\r\nthe rapidly changing climate, the cost of living, (and) 40,000 people sleeping\r\non the street.''\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 ``I believe that times of inflection require reflection -- I believe,\r\nit's time for Angelenos to remind ourselves where we come from and who we\r\nare,'' she said.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Bass scheduled a news conference at 9 a.m. Monday to declare a state\r\nof emergency on homelessness as her first act as mayor. Her reference to that\r\naction drew a standing ovation. The emergency declaration will ``recognize the\r\nseverity of our crisis and break new ground to maximize our ability to urgently\r\nmove people inside, and do so for good.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 ``It will create the structure necessary for us to have a true,\r\nunified and citywide strategy to set us on the path to solve homelessness,''\r\nBass said.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Bass' plan also includes housing 17,000 homeless people in her first\r\nyear. She said Los Angeles has earned the ``shameful crown'' of having some of\r\nthe most overcrowded neighborhoods in the country and called for residents to\r\n``welcome housing to every neighborhood.''\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 ``We know our mission: We must build housing in every neighborhood,''\r\nBass said. ``We cannot continue to overcrowd neighborhoods that are already\r\novercrowded.''\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 On crime, Bass sought a strategy to make neighborhoods safe ``that is\r\ninformed by our communities,'' which includes launching an Office of Community\r\nSafety.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 ``Of course, we must stop crimes in progress and hold people\r\naccountable,'' Bass said. ``Some neighborhoods have asked for additional\r\nofficers, and we will deliver. But what neighborhoods are asking for and what\r\nthey need is as diverse as our city.''\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Sunday's ceremony was initially scheduled to take place outside City\r\nHall, but rain in the forecast led to a venue shift indoors. Instead, Bass was\r\nsworn in on the theater's stage, with two large ``LA'' letters in the mold of\r\nthe LAX sign to her right and a picture of the Spring Street City Hall steps\r\nbehind the stage.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 ``In our city's 241-year history, we've never witnessed a day like\r\ntoday as Los Angeles came together to celebrate the swearing in of Mayor Karen\r\nBass,'' said Mark Gonzalez, chair of the Los Angeles County Democratic Party,\r\nin a statement.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Surprise performers at the inauguration included Stevie Wonder, who\r\nsang ``Keep Our Love Alive'' and ``Living for the City,'' and Chloe Bailey and\r\nLas Cafeteras. Amanda Gorman, the first National Youth Poet Laureate, who also\r\ndelivered a poem at President Joe Biden's inauguration, said in her reading\r\nSunday that ``the time of never before is officially past.''\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 ``For where there's will, there's women,'' Gorman said. ``And where\r\nthere's women, there's forever a way.''\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Sunday's event marked the first mayoral inauguration in Los Angeles in\r\nnearly a decade, with outgoing mayor Eric Garcetti holding the post since 2013.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Bass defeated developer Rick Caruso on Nov. 8 in an expensive and at-\r\ntimes contentious race.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 She will inherit leadership of a city grappling with a scandal that\r\nhas embroiled City Hall for the past two months, after three council members\r\nand a top county labor official took part in a recorded conversation in October\r\n2021 that included racist comments and attempts to manipulate redistricting.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 The fallout has continued to roil City Hall, with Councilman Kevin de\r\nLe\u00f3n -- one of the participants in the conversation -- unexpectedly returning\r\nto the chamber on Friday, setting off chaos as he continues to defy calls to\r\nresign. De Le\u00f3n later fought with an activist at a holiday tree lighting event\r\non Friday evening.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 City Council President Paul Krekorian, who swore in five new city\r\ncouncil members and a new city attorney and city controller at Sunday's\r\nceremony, said that there is no leader more capable of bringing the city\r\ntogether than Bass.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 ``This is a time of unprecedented challenges in our city, but today as\r\nI look out at this audience and see the people with us, I know that this is\r\nalso a time of unprecedented opportunity,'' Krekorian said.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Krekorian added that Bass will have a ``very strong part in the Los\r\nAngeles City Council,'' a positive sign for Bass -- who will need to have the\r\ncouncil renew her state of emergency for homelessness every month.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Bass, 69, grew up in the midst of the civil rights movement with three\r\nbrothers in the Venice and Fairfax neighborhoods. She was drawn to\r\ncommunity activism after watching the movement on television, volunteering for\r\nRobert F. Kennedy's 1968 presidential campaign when she was 14. Bass said while\r\nher parents did not live to see her take elected office, ``their love, support\r\nand guidance is why I stand before you today.''\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Bass' father fled the Jim Crow south during the great African American\r\nmigration after World War II and found work as a letter carrier. His\r\npaycheck supported Bass and her siblings, and allowed her mother to choose to\r\nbe a homemaker.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 ``When I think about the dreams of working people today, I reflect on\r\nthe fact that my mother and father were able to buy a home in Los Angeles for\r\ntheir family of six with one paycheck,'' Bass said.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Bass' organizing career began in 1990 when she founded Community\r\nCoalition, a South Los Angeles social justice group in response to the crack\r\ncocaine crisis. In 2004, Bass was the only Black woman in the state Legislature\r\nwhen she was elected to the Assembly. Four years later, she became the first\r\nBlack woman to lead the chamber. Bass was elected to the U.S. House of\r\nRepresentatives in 2010 and chaired the Congressional Black Caucus in 2019 and\r\n2020.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 State Senate President pro-Tempore Toni Atkins said that Bass didn't\r\nrun for mayor for ``credit or photo-opps.''\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 ``She is here to work,'' Atkins said. ``She is here because she loves\r\nthis city, she loves its people. She is here to answer the call to serve. And\r\nthat is who she is.''\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 The new mayor called for the city to focus on solutions rather than\r\njurisdiction, to link arms rather than point fingers.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 ``If we just focus on bringing people inside, comprehensively\r\naddressing their needs, and moving them to permanent housing with a way to pay\r\ntheir bills, we will save lives and save our city,'' Bass said. ``That is my\r\nmission as your mayor.''\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Bass said her father taught her to be a critical thinker, and to\r\nunderstand the historical context of national and international events.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 ``My daily conversations with him led me to make a lifetime commitment\r\nto do whatever I can to change the world,'' she said.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Through the ``unaffordability, the difficulty, the struggle working\r\npeople face today in Los Angeles,'' Bass said that Angelenos have ``never, ever\r\ngiven up.''\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 ``And our magic, L.A. magic, it's still here,'' she said.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Copyright 2022, City News Service, Inc.\n\r\nCNS-12-11-2022 20:50", "Generate a story that involves the following entities:\n- Bass Inauguration: PERSON\n- 12: CARDINAL\n- 8:50 PM: TIME\n- 3rd: ORDINAL\n- Hold News Conference\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Eds: ORG\n- Bass: PERSON\n- 7th: ORDINAL\n- Bass: PERSON\n- ERIC HE\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 City News Service: PERSON\n- LOS ANGELES: GPE\n- CNS: ORG\n- Karen Bass: PERSON\n- 43rd: ORDINAL\n- Los\r\nAngeles: GPE\n- today: DATE\n- the Microsoft Theater: ORG\n- first: ORDINAL\n- second: ORDINAL\n- Bass: PERSON\n- Kamala Harris: PERSON\n- California: GPE\n- first: ORDINAL\n- second: ORDINAL\n- Gavin Newsom: PERSON\n- today: DATE\n- Los Angeles: GPE\n- Bass: PERSON\n- Bass: PERSON\n- 40,000: CARDINAL\n- Angelenos: PERSON\n- Bass: PERSON\n- 9 a.m.: TIME\n- Monday: DATE\n- first: ORDINAL\n- Bass: PERSON\n- Bass: PERSON\n- 17,000: CARDINAL\n- her first\r\nyear: DATE\n- Los Angeles: GPE\n- Bass: PERSON\n- Bass: PERSON\n- an Office of Community\r\nSafety: ORG\n- Bass: PERSON\n- Sunday: DATE\n- City\r\nHall: FAC\n- Bass: PERSON\n- two: CARDINAL\n- LA: GPE\n- LAX: ORG\n- 241-year: DATE\n- a day: DATE\n- today: DATE\n- Los Angeles: GPE\n- Bass: PERSON\n- Mark Gonzalez: PERSON\n- the Los Angeles County Democratic Party: ORG\n- Stevie Wonder: PERSON\n- Keep Our Love: WORK_OF_ART\n- Living for the City: WORK_OF_ART\n- Chloe Bailey: PERSON\n- Las Cafeteras: ORG\n- Amanda Gorman: PERSON\n- first: ORDINAL\n- Joe Biden's: PERSON\n- Sunday: DATE\n- Gorman: PERSON\n- Sunday: DATE\n- first: ORDINAL\n- Los Angeles: GPE\n- nearly a decade: DATE\n- Eric Garcetti: PERSON\n- 2013: DATE\n- Bass: PERSON\n- Rick Caruso: PERSON\n- Nov. 8: DATE\n- City Hall: FAC\n- the past two months: DATE\n- three: CARDINAL\n- October\r\n2021: DATE\n- City Hall: FAC\n- Councilman Kevin de\r\nLe\u00f3n: PERSON\n- Friday: DATE\n- De Le\u00f3n: PERSON\n- Friday: DATE\n- evening: TIME\n- City Council: ORG\n- Paul Krekorian: PERSON\n- five: CARDINAL\n- new city: GPE\n- Sunday: DATE\n- Bass: PERSON\n- today: DATE\n- Krekorian: PERSON\n- Krekorian: PERSON\n- Bass: PERSON\n- the Los\r\nAngeles City Council: ORG\n- Bass: PERSON\n- every month: DATE\n- Bass: PERSON\n- 69: DATE\n- three: CARDINAL\n- Venice: GPE\n- Fairfax: GPE\n- Robert F.

ADDS details from afternoon court session. Closing\r\narguments are scheduled to continue at\u00a0\u00a09:30 a.m. TOMORROW in Dept. 110,\r\nCriminal Courts Building, 210 W. Temple St.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 By TERRI VERMEULEN KEITH\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 City News Service\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 LOS ANGELES (CNS) - A prosecutor urged jurors today to end former film\r\nproducer Harvey Weinstein's ``reign of terror'' and convict him of sex-\r\nrelated charges involving four women, while a lawyer for one of the\r\nentertainment industry's icons questioned the credibility of his accusers and\r\nsaid the government had a failing case that should result in his client's\r\nacquittal.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Jurors are expected to be handed the case against Weinstein after\r\nhearing the prosecution's rebuttal argument Friday.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Weinstein, now 70, is charged with seven sex-related counts involving\r\nthe four women, including Gov. Gavin Newsom's wife, Jennifer Siebel Newsom, who\r\ntold jurors she still lives with the trauma of being raped and sexually\r\nassaulted by Weinstein in a Beverly Hills hotel room 17 years ago.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Jurors also heard from four other women who were allegedly sexually\r\nassaulted by Weinstein, but are not listed as charged victims in the case.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 In his closing argument, defense attorney Alan Jackson told the\r\ndowntown Los Angeles jury that the entirety of the prosecution's case could be\r\nsummed up with five words -- ``Take my word for it'' -- and said that the four\r\nalleged victims were ``untruthful'' in their testimony and that they had ``told\r\nyou lies.''\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Weinstein -- whom Deputy District Attorney Marlene Martinez had\r\nearlier called a ``titan of the film industry'' -- engaged in ``despicable\r\nbehavior'' and made sure that the alleged victims knew he ``could destroy\r\nthem,'' according to the prosecutor.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Jackson countered, ``Did one person come in here and say, `I said no\r\nto Harvey Weinstein and he screwed my career?' Was there one? ... Not one\r\nperson said that because it's a fable ... It just isn't true.''\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Weinstein's attorney contended that two of the alleged attacks\r\ninvolving Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2\u00a0\u00a0``simply never happened'' and that they\r\nwere ``fictionalized'' accounts of events that never occurred, while\r\nWeinstein's relationship with the other two alleged victims, including the\r\ngovernor's wife, was ``100% consensual'' and had ``transactional\r\nrelationships'' and ``hate it now unequivocally.''\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 The defense attorney ended his closing argument with an attack on the\r\ntestimony of Siebel Newsom, which he called a ``theatrical, overly dramatized\r\nperformance'' that was a ``pretty good act'' that had ``no basis in truth.''\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 ``Jane Doe 4 cannot square in her mind that she's a successful, well-\r\neducated, well-bred, refined woman who had consensual sex with Harvey Weinstein\r\nin exchange for opportunity and access,'' he said of the governor's wife.\r\n``Regret is far from rape. You don't get to rewrite your own history no matter\r\nwho you're married to.''\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 As she wrapped up her closing argument Thursday, the prosecutor told\r\njurors, ``It is time for the defendant's reign of terror to end ... It is time\r\nfor the kingmaker to be brought to justice.''\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Martinez had told jurors earlier in her closing argument that\r\nWeinstein was a ``titan of the film industry'' who used his power to prey on\r\nand silence women. She called him a ``predator,'' and said none of the eight\r\nwomen knew each other.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 She noted that the women knew they would come to court and face tough\r\nquestioning from the defense, and that they knew ``his attorneys would call\r\nthem bimbos in open court for having been raped.''\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 In his opening statement as the trial got underway in October, defense\r\nattorney Mark Werksman said of Siebel Newsom -- who was identified only in\r\ncourt as Jane Doe #4 but has publicly been identified by her attorney -- that\r\nshe has been a prominent figure in the #MeToo movement, and said that,\r\n``Otherwise, she'd just be another bimbo who slept with Harvey Weinstein to get\r\nahead in Hollywood.''\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Two of the charges -- forcible rape and forcible oral copulation --\r\nstem from the alleged attack on Siebel Newsom, a documentary filmmaker, at his\r\nsuite at The Peninsula Beverly Hills in September 2005.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Weinstein is also facing one additional count each of forcible rape\r\nand forcible oral copulation along with one count of sexual penetration by a\r\nforeign object involving another alleged victim in 2013, and two counts of\r\nsexual battery by restraint involving two other women in 2010 and 2013.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Prosecutors opted not to proceed with four other counts -- two counts\r\neach of forcible rape and forcible oral copulation involving ``Jane Doe #5,''\r\nwho had not been mentioned in the prosecution's opening statement but was one\r\nof the charged victims in the indictment against Weinstein.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Prosecutors have described Weinstein as one of the most powerful\r\npeople in the industry at the time of the alleged crimes. Deputy District\r\nAttorney Paul Thompson told jurors at the start of the case that Weinstein and\r\nhis brother, Bob, created Miramax Films, which produced a number of ``iconic\r\nand award-winning films'' including ``Pulp Fiction,'' ``The English Patient,''\r\n``Good Will Hunting'' and ``Shakespeare In Love,'' among others. The movies\r\nlaunched the careers of Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Gwyneth Paltrow and Quentin\r\nTarantino, Thompson said.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Weinstein did not testify in his own defense.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 He was extradited from New York, where he was convicted of raping an\r\naspiring actress and of a criminal sex act against a former production\r\nassistant. The state's highest court has since agreed to hear his appeal\r\ninvolving that case.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Weinstein remains behind bars.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Copyright 2022, City News Service, Inc.\n\r\n CNS-12-01-2022 17:36\n", "Generate a story that involves the following entities:\n- Harvey Weinstein: PERSON\n- LdDate: ORG\n- 12-01-2022: DATE\n- 5:36 PM: TIME\n- 963Harvey: CARDINAL\n- 2nd: CARDINAL\n- afternoon: TIME\n- 9:30 a.m.: TIME\n- TOMORROW: DATE\n- Dept: GPE\n- 110: CARDINAL\n- Criminal Courts Building: ORG\n- 210: CARDINAL\n- W.

Observatory Road,\r\naccording to City Councilwoman Nithya Raman's office.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 The puma, who became the face of an international effort to save\r\nCalifornia's endangered mountain lion population, was widely mourned following\r\nthe news of his death, several days after he was captured in a Los Feliz\r\nbackyard and found to be injured, severely underweight and suffering from other\r\nailments.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 ``RIP P-22,'' community organizer Christian La Mont tweeted Saturday.\r\n``He wasn't just a big cat. He was a symbol of resistance. Resistance to the\r\nidea that LA has no wildlife, to development in his own backyard, to dwindling\r\nnumbers of mountain lions in SoCal. He lived his 9 cat lives to the fullest &\r\ncaptured our hearts.''\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Karen Tongson called P-22 ``the last, true Hollywood celeb. Thanks for\r\nputting up with all of humanity's bull---. I'm sorry we couldn't do right\r\nby you in the end.''\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Officials with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife\r\nannounced Saturday morning that P-22 had been ``compassionately euthanized''\r\nafter a comprehensive medical evaluation showed he had ``several severe\r\ninjuries and chronic health problems.''\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 ``This really hurts,'' CDFW Director Chuck Bonham said, fighting back\r\ntears. ``It's been an incredibly difficult several days, and for myself, I felt\r\nthe entire weight of the city of Los Angeles on my shoulders.''\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Bonham said that after consultation with several veterinary experts,\r\nthe decision was made to humanely euthanize the animal at San Diego Zoo Safari\r\nPark, where he was being treated, to spare him further suffering.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 The lion, one of many Southland-area cats being tracked by National\r\nPark Service researchers, gained fame locally for his persistence and\r\ndurability, successfully managing to cross both the San Diego (405) and\r\nHollywood (101) freeways to reach his recent roaming grounds in the Griffith\r\nPark area.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 ``P-22's advanced age, combined with chronic, debilitating, life-\r\nshortening conditions and the clear need for extensive long-term veterinary\r\nintervention left P-22 with no hope for a positive outcome,\" the CDFW said in a\r\nstatement.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Known as the ``Hollywood Cat,'' P-22 became the face of the NPS' lion-\r\ntracking effort. His exploits were documented in various media accounts,\r\nincluding the freeway crossings, hiding out under a Los Feliz home in a\r\nstandoff that drew widespread attention and even being named a suspect in the\r\nkilling of a koala at the Los Angeles Zoo.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 He was believed to be about 11 or 12 years old, making him the oldest\r\ncat in the NPS' study of Southland lions. He is believed to have been born in\r\nthe Santa Monica Mountains, somehow finding his way to his tiny, nine-square-\r\nmile home in Griffith Park, separated from his birth area by two of the busiest\r\nfreeways in the world.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Defying expectations, he persisted for more than 10 years in the\r\nsmallest home range that has ever been recorded for an adult male mountain\r\nlion.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 He was initially captured and outfitted with a tracking collar in\r\n2012. At the time of his last capture, he weighed 123 pounds.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Officials again noted the facial injury Saturday, but said the most\r\nserious issue was a herniation of the lion's abdominal organs into his chest,\r\nalong with significant pre-existing illnesses that were causing him to\r\ndeteriorate, including ``irreversible kidney disease, chronic weight loss,\r\nextensive parasitic skin infection over his entire body and localized\r\narthritis.''\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Bowman noted that evidence suggests P-22 could have been struck by a\r\nvehicle Sunday evening, though that hasn't been definitively confirmed.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 A memorial service was planned for the animal sometime after the\r\nholidays, but no specific details were announced. P-22 will receive a post-\r\nmortem examination, and will contribute to multiple research studies before\r\nreturning to the Los Angeles Natural History Museum, according to CDFW Senior\r\nWildlife Veterinarian Dr. Deana Clifford.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Officials hope the completion of the Wallis Annenberg Wildlife\r\nCrossing project near Agoura Hills will dramatically improve conditions for the\r\nregion's sparse mountain lion population. The crossing will span over 10 lanes\r\nof the Ventura (101) Freeway in Liberty Canyon when completed in 2025, and aims\r\nto provide a connection between the small population of mountain lions in the\r\nSanta Monica Mountains and the larger and genetically diverse populations to\r\nthe north.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 ``Mountain lion P-22 was more than just a celebrity cat. He was also a\r\ncritical part of a long-term research study and a valuable ambassador for\r\nthe cause of connectivity and for wildlife in the Santa Monica Mountains and\r\nbeyond,'' according to a statement from the Santa Monica Mountains National\r\nRecreation Area.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 `` ... Although he made frequent appearances on the streets of the\r\nHollywood Hills and even, more recently, of the Silver Lake neighborhood, he\r\nwas also clearly a wild cat, doing so mostly late at night, and subsisting\r\nlargely on natural prey such as deer and coyotes.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 ``In the end, he found his way into many Angelenos' hearts and home\r\nsurveillance camera footage,'' the statement continued. ``...This animal's life\r\nand safe passage to Griffith Park are a testament to both the challenges and\r\nthe possibilities for wildlife in Los Angeles. He showed us what mountain lions\r\nmust do to survive in our urban landscape, as he dispersed through it to find a\r\nremaining island of habitat.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 ``He also showed us what they are capable of: surviving and co-\r\nexisting with millions of people in a city as dense and sprawling as Los\r\nAngeles.''\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Gov. Gavin Newsom, whose father was a founder of the Mountain Lion\r\nFoundation and championed protections for the species, said P-22's survival\r\n``on an island of wilderness in the heart of Los Angeles captivated people\r\naround the world and revitalized efforts to protect our diverse native species\r\nand ecosystems. The iconic mountain lion's incredible journey helped inspire a\r\nnew era of conserving and reconnecting nature, including through the world's\r\nlargest wildlife overpass in Liberty Canyon. With innovative coalitions and\r\nstrategies to restore vital habitat across the state, we'll continue working to\r\nprotect California's precious natural heritage for generations to come.''\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 ``This is a hard chapter to close,'' Friends of Griffith Park\r\nPresident Gerry Hans said. ``It was FoGP that `discovered' P-22 and introduced\r\nhim to the world. For a year, we were capturing images of deer, coyote and\r\nbobcats. None of our scientists ever imagined getting an image of a mountain\r\nlion. But there he was. February 12, 2012, 9:15 p.m. ... Griffith Park gave P-\r\n22 everything a solitary cat needed: food, shelter and a place to roam, even\r\nthough the 4,300 acres of the park is an incredibly small territory for a\r\nmountain lion.''\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Beth Pratt, California regional executive director for the National\r\nWildlife Federation, also issued an emotional eulogy for P-22, marveling that\r\n``a mountain lion lived here, right here in Los Angeles.''\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Pratt shared her experience of meeting the animal shortly before his\r\ndemise.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 ``I am so grateful I was given the opportunity to say goodbye to P-22.\r\nAlthough I have advocated for his protection for a decade, we had never met\r\nbefore,'' she wrote. ``I sat near him, looking into his eyes for a few minutes,\r\nand told him he was a good boy. I told him how much I loved him. How much the\r\nworld loved him. And I told him I was so sorry that we did not make the world a\r\nsafer place for him. I apologized that despite all I and others who cared for\r\nhim did, we failed him.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 `` ... P-22 never fully got to be a mountain lion. His whole life, he\r\nsuffered the consequences of trying to survive in unconnected space, right to\r\nthe end when being hit by a car led to his tragic end. He showed people around\r\nthe world that we need to ensure our roads, highways, and communities are\r\nbetter and safer when people and wildlife can freely travel to find food,\r\nshelter, and families. The Wallis Annenberg Wildlife Crossing would not have\r\nbeen possible without P-22, but the most fitting memorial to P-22 will be how\r\nwe carry his story forward in the work ahead. One crossing is not enough -- we\r\nmust build more, and we must continue to invest in proactive efforts to protect\r\nand conserve wildlife and the habitats they depend on -- even in urban areas.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 ``P-22's journey to and life in Griffith Park was a miracle,'' Pratt\r\ncontinued. ``It's my hope that future mountain lions will be able to walk in\r\nthe steps of P-22 without risking their lives on California's highways and\r\nstreets. We owe it to P-22 to build more crossings and connect the habitats\r\nwhere we live now.''\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Decades of road construction and development have been deadly for\r\nanimals trying to cross freeways, and have created islands of habitat that have\r\ngenetically isolated wildlife from bobcats to birds and lizards.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Wildlife advocates hope the crossing can save the threatened local\r\npopulation of mountain lions from extinction. They've also characterized the\r\nfuture structure as ``a global model for urban wildlife conservation'' that\r\nwill ``benefit the wildlife and ecology of the area for generations to come.''\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 The $85 million project will be the largest crossing of its kind in\r\nthe world, stretching 210 feet over the freeway. More information about the\r\ncampaign to help the mountain lions can be found at https://savelacougars.org/.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Officials at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County said\r\nthey planned to update ``The Story of P-22, L.A.'s Most Famous Feline,'' a\r\npermanent exhibit that debuted in 2017, in the coming year, with added stories,\r\nprograms and more. The museum also recently debuted a P-22 marionette that\r\nallows a performing artist team to further bring his story to life.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 ``On behalf of everyone at NHMLAC, we are very saddened by the loss of\r\nP-22, an iconic ambassador for wildlife in Los Angeles,'' said Miguel\r\nOrde\u00f1ana, Senior Manager of Community Science at the museum. ``His passing is a\r\npainful moment, but we are so thankful for how he created a better\r\nunderstanding of the coexistence of urban wildlife, humans and L.A.'s\r\nbiodiversity. His story is a catalyst for change, inspiring conservation\r\nefforts, including the 101 freeway wildlife crossing and much more.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 ``Even in his death, P-22 continues to inspire L.A. to embrace urban\r\nwildlife conservation and the nature that surrounds us,'' Orde\u00f1ana said.\r\n``NHMLAC will continue to share his story, and honor and preserve his legacy\r\nfor generations to come.''\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 CDFW officials paid tribute to P-22 as a great ambassador for his\r\nspecies and one of the driving forces behind the effort to complete the freeway\r\ncrossing.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 ``He's never going to be forgotten and he can't be forgotten,'' Bonham\r\nsaid. ``We put him in this predicament.''\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Copyright 2022, City News Service, Inc.\n\r\n CNS-12-18-2022 12:28", "Generate a story that involves the following entities:\n- LdDate: ORG\n- 12-18-2022: CARDINAL\n- 12:28 PM: TIME\n- 1961P22, 1st: DATE\n- Ld\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Memorial Hike Planned at Griffith Park for Iconic Mountain Lion P-22\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Eds: Re: ORG\n- 4 p.m.: TIME\n- Charlie Turner: PERSON\n- Trailhead: PERSON\n- 2840: DATE\n- mountains-national-recreation-area.htm: GPE\n- Jordan Traverso: PERSON\n- 916-212-7352: CARDINAL\n- Ashton Hooker: ORG\n- Santa Monica: GPE\n- LOS ANGELES: GPE\n- CNS: ORG\n- Griffith\r\nPark: ORG\n- today: DATE\n- P-22: PRODUCT\n- Los Angeles: GPE\n- Saturday: DATE\n- 4 p.m.: TIME\n- Charlie Turner Trailhead: PERSON\n- 2840: DATE\n- City Councilwoman Nithya Raman's: ORG\n- California: GPE\n- several days: DATE\n- Los Feliz: GPE\n- RIP P-22: PRODUCT\n- Christian: NORP\n- Saturday: DATE\n- LA: GPE\n- SoCal: GPE\n- 9: CARDINAL\n- Karen Tongson: PERSON\n- P-22: PRODUCT\n- Hollywood: GPE\n- the California Department of Fish: ORG\n- Saturday: DATE\n- morning: TIME\n- P-22: PRODUCT\n- Chuck Bonham: PERSON\n- several days: DATE\n- Los Angeles: GPE\n- Bonham: PERSON\n- San Diego Zoo: FAC\n- one: CARDINAL\n- Southland: ORG\n- National\r\nPark Service: ORG\n- the San Diego: GPE\n- 405: CARDINAL\n- Hollywood: GPE\n- 101: CARDINAL\n- Griffith: GPE\n- P-22: PRODUCT\n- NPS: ORG\n- Los Feliz: GPE\n- the Los Angeles Zoo: ORG\n- about 11 or: CARDINAL\n- 12 years old: DATE\n- NPS: ORG\n- Southland: ORG\n- Santa Monica Mountains: GPE\n- nine: CARDINAL\n- Griffith Park: GPE\n- two: CARDINAL\n- more than 10 years: DATE\n- 2012: DATE\n- 123 pounds: QUANTITY\n- Saturday: DATE\n- Bowman: PERSON\n- P-22: PRODUCT\n- Sunday: DATE\n- evening: TIME\n- the\r\nholidays: DATE\n- the Los Angeles Natural History Museum: ORG\n- Veterinarian: NORP\n- Deana Clifford: PERSON\n- the Wallis Annenberg Wildlife\r\nCrossing: LOC\n- Agoura Hills: GPE\n- over 10: CARDINAL\n- Ventura: GPE\n- 101: CARDINAL\n- Liberty Canyon: GPE\n- 2025: DATE\n- Santa Monica Mountains: GPE\n- P-22: PRODUCT\n- Santa Monica Mountains: GPE\n- Santa Monica: GPE\n- Hollywood Hills: GPE\n- Silver Lake: GPE\n- Angelenos: ORG\n- Griffith Park: FAC\n- Los Angeles: GPE\n- millions: CARDINAL\n- Los\r\nAngeles: GPE\n- Gavin Newsom: PERSON\n- the Mountain Lion\r\nFoundation: ORG\n- P-22: PRODUCT\n- Los Angeles: GPE\n- Liberty Canyon: LOC\n- California: GPE\n- Friends of Griffith Park: WORK_OF_ART\n- Gerry Hans: PERSON\n- It was FoGP: WORK_OF_ART\n- P-22: PRODUCT\n- a year: DATE\n- February 12, 2012: DATE\n- 9:15 p.m.: TIME\n- 22: CARDINAL\n- the 4,300 acres: QUANTITY\n- Beth Pratt: PERSON\n- California: GPE\n- the National\r\nWildlife Federation: ORG\n- P-22: PRODUCT\n- Los Angeles: GPE\n- P-22: PRODUCT\n- a decade: DATE\n- a few minutes: TIME\n- The Wallis Annenberg Wildlife Crossing: PERSON\n- P-22: PRODUCT\n- P-22: PRODUCT\n- One: CARDINAL\n- P-22: PRODUCT\n- Griffith Park: GPE\n- P-22: PRODUCT\n- California: GPE\n- P-22: PRODUCT\n- $85 million: MONEY\n- 210 feet: QUANTITY\n- https://savelacougars.org/.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Officials: ORG\n- the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County: ORG\n- ``The Story of P-22: WORK_OF_ART\n- L.A.: GPE\n- 2017: DATE\n- the coming year: DATE\n- P-22: PRODUCT\n- NHMLAC: ORG\n- P-22: PRODUCT\n- Los Angeles: GPE\n- Miguel\r\nOrde\u00f1ana: PERSON\n- Community Science: ORG\n- L.A.: GPE\n- 101: FAC\n- P-22: PRODUCT\n- L.A.: GPE\n- Orde\u00f1ana: ORG\n- NHMLAC: ORG\n- P-22: PRODUCT\n- one: CARDINAL\n- Bonham: PERSON\n- 2022: DATE\n- City News Service: ORG\n- 12:28: TIME\n\nBegin story:", "\n\nOfficials from the Los Angeles Natural History Museum, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, and the National Park Service are planning a memorial hike in Griffith Park to honor the iconic mountain lion P-22. \n\nThe hike will take place on Saturday, December 18th, 2022 at 4 p.m. at the Charlie Turner Trailhead, 2840, and will be led by City Councilwoman Nithya Raman's office.

Bob Boese of the Sheriff's Information Bureau can be reached at 323-422-\r\n0536.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 LOS ANGELES (CNS) - After the formality of a weekend swearing-in\r\nceremony, Robert Luna today officially assumes his duties as the 34th sheriff\r\nof Los Angeles County.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 The former Long Beach Police chief took the oath of office on Saturday\r\nmorning during a ceremony at the county Hall of Administration in downtown\r\nL.A. -- his wife Celines pinning the gold star on his crisp new tan-and-green\r\nuniform while their two adult children stood nearby.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Monday at noon -- following a hard-fought campaign that led to the\r\nouster of incumbent Alex Villanueva -- Luna officially takes command of the\r\nnation's largest sheriff's department, with more than 18,000 sworn personnel.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 ``Today I stand before you wearing this brand-new uniform -- and now I\r\nhave a badge to go with it -- with an incredible amount of respect, because\r\nit's the same uniform worn by those deputies who patrolled the neighborhood\r\nwhere I grew up,'' Luna said Saturday, referring to his East L.A. roots.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Saturday's ceremony was also attended by current and former city and\r\npolice officials from Long Beach, and by L.A. County officials, including four\r\nof the five county supervisors.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Luna promised to be open to different approaches to tackle what he\r\nacknowledged was a rising tide of crime in the county.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 ``There can be no sacred cows,'' Luna said.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 He said the sheriff's department has succeeded over the years\r\n``because it has never been afraid to innovate. ... So we must look at policies\r\nand strategies that have succeeded in other places and not be afraid to bring\r\nthem here.''\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Luna also implored the public to defend ``good policing,'' while at\r\nthe same time recognizing the need to hold law enforcement accountable.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 ``But even as we make mistakes, we can and we must keep the public\r\ntrust,'' he said.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 The new sheriff said he will focus on three overriding principles:\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 -- Integrity. ``It's about living up to the law enforcement code of\r\nethics, doing the right thing even when no one is looking.''\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 -- Accountability. ``If crime goes, up, that's on us. ... We owe you,\r\nthe community, a plan to reduce crime.''\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 And, in a veiled shot at Villanueva -- who was frequently assailed by\r\nLuna and other elected officials over his contentious relationship with the\r\ncounty Board of Supervisors:\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 -- Collaboration. ``We will fail if we take an `us versus them'\r\nattitude,'' Luna said. ``We cannot do that. We need less polarization and more\r\npartnerships, and we will do that.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 ``We are going to fix problems, not affix blame.''\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Luna also mentioned the need to eliminate deputy gangs and improve\r\nconditions in jails. During the campaign, he accused Villanueva of ignoring the\r\nissue of deputy gangs, and of cultivating a hostile relationship with the\r\nsupervisors.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Before Luna was sworn in, outgoing Long Beach Mayor Robert Garcia, who\r\nwas elected to Congress earlier this month, spoke on behalf of his longtime\r\ncolleague -- praising his handling of civil unrest that followed the killing of\r\nGeorge Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer in May 2020. Garcia also praised\r\nLuna's character.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 ``Robert's core values are rooted in collaboration, in strength, and\r\nin kindness,'' Garcia said. ``... Luna is going to be one of the kindest people\r\nyou'll ever meet.''\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Holly Mitchell, the only county supervisor who did not attend the\r\nceremony, later tweeted her congratulations.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 ``Welcome, Sheriff Robert Luna! I look forward to your leadership and\r\ncommitment to restoring public trust in the Sheriff's Department. Our\r\ncommunities deserve accountability and transparency, which can only be achieved\r\nby working together,'' Mitchell wrote.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Luna spent 36 years with the Long Beach Police Department, becoming\r\nchief in 2014.

Selna said Avenatti's sentence will run\r\nconsecutively -- or on top of -- the five years he is already serving for\r\nconvictions in New York for an extortion scheme against Nike, and for stealing\r\nfrom Daniels. That brings his total time to about 19 years in prison for the 51-\r\nyear-old, who will have to serve at least 85% of the sentence.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Federal prosecutors in Santa Ana had asked Selna to impose a 17 1/2-\r\nyear term, while Avenatti was arguing for only six years. Avenatti also argued,\r\nunsuccessfully, that his sentence in Orange County run concurrent with the\r\npunishment he is already serving for the New York cases.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 He made an ``open plea'' to resolve most of the charges against him in\r\nSanta Ana, meaning he had no guarantee what punishment prosecutors would\r\nseek. It is a rare move for defendants because they have no idea what\r\npunishment they may face.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 ``I am deeply sorry and remorseful for my criminal conduct,'' Avenatti\r\ntold Selna Monday.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 He said the victims ``were not only my clients, but my friends ... and\r\nI inexplicably later took them in.''\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Avenatti's voice cracked as he pleaded for ``mercy'' from Selna for\r\n``another chance to be a father of my daughters and my young son, who is 8 and\r\ndeserves a father.''\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Avenatti added, ``A total combined sentence of 14 years at my age will\r\nnot give me a meaningful chance'' to be a parent and right some of his wrongs.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 ``I am not an evil or vile man,'' he said, referring to how\r\nprosecutors characterized him.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Avenatti said he helped a rape victim in Palm Springs while he was out\r\non bail in the case. He also pointed to other major litigation he won, such\r\nas a lawsuit against a personal protective equipment manufacturer.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 He said he offered the cases not as an excuse, but to address the\r\ncriticism from Assistant U.S. Attorney Brett Sagel, who said Avenatti's remorse\r\nwas ``of a recent vintage,'' and that as much as he characterized his law\r\ncareer as a David battling Goliaths, ``He doesn't fight for anyone but himself.\r\nWe know what's the most important thing to him -- himself.''\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 One of Avenatti's victims, Alexis Gardner, recalled a David vs.\r\nGoliath speech from her former attorney.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 ``He was the Goliath. He was the person stepping on the smaller\r\npeople,'' Gardner told Selna.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 She noted how Avenatti took her settlement money to help put a final\r\npayment on a private jet.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 She said she struggles with ``nightmares. I feel unsafe, stalked...\r\nIt's constantly troubling, depressing.''\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Another victim, Geoffrey Johnson, who Avenatti represented when he\r\nbecame a paraplegic while in jail, told Selna how reluctant he was to come to\r\ncourt on Monday because of the ``abusive'' way he was cross-examined by\r\nAvenatti, who acted as his own attorney in the trial.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 ``Next to being paralyzed, meeting Michael was the next worst thing\r\nthat ever happened to me,'' Johnson said.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 He recalled how in 2017 Avenatti ``led me on a wild goose chase to buy\r\na house ... when in reality he had already spent all of my funds.''\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Johnson, like Gardner, said they have trouble trusting anyone now.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 ``As is the case with most human beings, there is the ability to do\r\ngreat good on an individual level,'' Selna said. ``But there is also the\r\nability to do great evil.''\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Selna acknowledged that Avenatti has done ``noble and good things in\r\nhis life... But he has also done great evil for which he must answer. His\r\nactions in this case and in the relevant conduct show an abandonment of some of\r\nthe most basic principles of fairness. ... It is now time for him to pay his\r\ndebts to his victims, the government, and society in general.''\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Selna ordered Avenatti to pay $10,810,709 in restitution to four\r\nclients and for the back taxes he failed to pay to the IRS.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Avenatti spent a great deal of time during the sentencing challenging\r\nthe restitution order, arguing that prosecutors failed to calculate the amounts\r\ncorrectly or provide the required proof.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Prosecutors dismissed the remaining case against Avenatti, who asked\r\nSelna for a recommendation to be placed in the prison in Lompoc ``so I can be\r\nnear my family.'' Selna agreed to make the recommendation.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Avenatti, who won a mistrial motion last year when Selna found\r\nprosecutors had withheld evidence the attorney was seeking to use in his trial,\r\nsaid he made the open plea to spare the five victims another trial, the court\r\nsystem the expense, and because he could not reach an agreement on a plea deal\r\nwith prosecutors.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 In their sentencing recommendation, federal prosecutors said\r\nAvenatti's schemes followed a ``general pattern'' in which he ``would lie about\r\nthe true terms of the settlement agreement he had negotiated for the client,\r\nconceal the settlement payments that the counterparty had made, secretly take\r\nand spend the settlement proceeds that belonged to the client, and lull the\r\nclient into not complaining or investigating further by providing small\r\n`advances' on the supposedly yet-to-be-paid funds.''\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Prosecutors also said he was a ``tax cheat,'' and cited his failure to\r\npay payroll taxes after his firm acquired Tully's Coffee in bankruptcy and\r\nthen obstructed the IRS when the agency attempted to collect the amount due.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Prosecutors argued that Avenatti stole $12.35 million from his\r\nclients, failed to pay about $3.2 million in payroll taxes from the coffee\r\ncompany, and $1.6 million in payroll taxes from his law firm.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 The prosecutors argued that his convictions in New York federal courts\r\nshould also boost his punishment.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Avenatti argued that the sentence was more than what has been handed\r\ndown in similar white-collar fraud cases.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 He painted a picture of a difficult childhood that led him to believe\r\nhe had to ``work hard and rely solely on himself to achieve success and\r\ncontribute to society,'' his advisory counsel, Dean Steward, wrote in the\r\nsentencing brief.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 He said he started working at 15, including at a McDonald's and in\r\nretail stores, and that when he was 17 he worked at an ``athletic complex'' in\r\nSt. Louis, ``where he managed five employees and umpired over 500 baseball\r\ngames.''\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Avenatti had to work full time to pay for his college education and\r\nwas the first in his family to earn advanced degrees. He earned a law degree\r\nfrom George Washington University Law School, moved to California and passed\r\nthe Bar on his first try and settled in Newport Beach in 2000.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Avenatti also argued that his jailing in New York City while awaiting\r\ntrial there in ``horrendous conditions'' should lead to a lesser sentence. He\r\nfiled a claim with the government alleging he was placed in solitary\r\nconfinement as punishment for being a prominent critic of former President\r\nDonald Trump. The claim was denied.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 During the pandemic, Selna ordered Avenatti serve under home\r\nconfinement with a friend in Venice as he awaited his trials.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 While in custody at Terminal Island, Avenatti has a ``spotless\r\ndisciplinary record, has been a model inmate, and currently has a security\r\nclassification of minimum,'' Steward wrote.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Avenatti was also admitted into a treatment program and is active in\r\nAlcoholics Anonymous. In addition, he has been taking courses to ``prepare him\r\nfor a life after prison'' as the suspended attorney will soon surrender his law\r\nlicense and will not be able to ever practice the law again, Steward noted.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 While the government argued there was no way the two cases in New York\r\ncould be combined, Avenatti said they should have been. He argued that had\r\nthat been done, he would not be facing the prospect of a past criminal history\r\nthat boosted his exposure in the Santa Ana case.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Avenatti had no prior criminal history before his convictions in New York.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 He argued federal prosecutors forced him to defend three cases on both\r\ncoasts and could have combined them all into one case.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Avenatti said, ``This highly unusual decision resulted from\r\ndefendant's notoriety, the government's desire to have three high-profile\r\nprosecutions of defendant, and an internal `turf' battle within the Department\r\nof Justice.''\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 He added, ``This is improper and highly prejudicial.''\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Avenatti quoted former Southern District of New York U.S. Attorney\r\nGeoffrey Berman's book on his efforts to work out the so-called turf battle\r\nwith former Central District of California U.S. Attorney Nichola Hanna.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 U.S. Attorney Martin Estrada, however, denied there was any turf\r\nbattle or any attempt to enhance punishment for Avenatti.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 ``We operate in a way that is not just compliant with the law but also\r\nethics, so in no way did we prosecute this case or act in a matter to\r\nsomehow violate Mr. Avenatti's rights,'' Estrada told reporters after the\r\nhearing.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Assistant U.S. Attorney Ranee Katzenstein added that the judge in\r\nAvenatti's Nike case ``rejected'' the same argument from the defendant.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Copyright 2022, City News Service, Inc.\n\r\n CNS-12-05-2022 14:52\n", "Generate a story that involves the following entities:\n- Avenatti Sentencing: PERSON\n- 3rd LdDate: ORG\n- 12: CARDINAL\n- 2:52 PM: TIME\n- 1559Avenatti: CARDINAL\n- 3rd: ORDINAL\n- 14 Years: DATE\n- City News Service: ORG\n- CNS: ORG\n- Michael Avenatti: PERSON\n- Stormy Daniels: ORG\n- Donald Trump: PERSON\n- Orange County: GPE\n- today to 14 years: DATE\n- U.S.: GPE\n- James V.

Selna in Orange County, California. The sentence is the result of Avenatti's conviction on charges related to his extortion of Nike and defrauding of his former client Stormy Daniels and other clients. The sentence is longer than the five years requested by prosecutors and the 12 months requested by Avenatti's lawyers.\n\nAvenatti, a 51-year-old Newport Beach attorney, was convicted in February of all three counts he faced: honest services wire fraud, extortion and transmission of interstate communications with intent to extort. He was found guilty of attempting to extort Nike for at least $85 million and defrauding Daniels of about $300,000.\n\nAt the sentencing hearing in Santa Ana, Selna said Avenatti had committed \"a very serious offense\" and that \"a substantial term of imprisonment is required.\" He imposed a sentence of 14 years in prison, followed by five years of supervised release.\n\nAvenatti had already been sentenced in the Nike case in New York to three years in prison and in the Daniels case in California to 17 1/2 years, but Selna said he would run the sentences concurrently. This means Avenatti will only serve 14 years, rather than the combined total of about 19 years.\n\nIn addition to the prison sentence, Selna ordered Avenatti to pay restitution of $10,810,709 to victims in four separate cases, including the IRS. Avenatti was also ordered to pay a $250,000 fine and to forfeit $2.75 million.\n\nAvenatti had been in custody since last year, when he was arrested in Palm Springs, California, on charges of violating the terms of his release in the New York case. U.S. District Judge Brett Sagel had ordered him to stay in the Southern District of New York, but Avenatti had gone to California.\n\nAt the sentencing hearing, Avenatti's lawyer, Alexis Gardner, compared Avenatti to David, the biblical figure who fought Goliath. She said Avenatti had taken on \"some of the most powerful Goliaths in the world,\" including Donald Trump and Nike.\n\nGardner said Avenatti had been punished enough by the time he'd already served in jail and by the \"public humiliation\" he had suffered. She asked Selna to sentence Avenatti to only six years in prison.\n\nAvenatti had faced a maximum sentence of 335 years in prison for the three convictions.\n\nSelna said on Monday that he believed Avenatti had a \"history of deception\" and had \"abused the trust of those around him.\" He noted that Avenatti had failed to pay $8 million in taxes and had failed to pay $12.35 million in restitution to a former client.\n\nThe judge also noted that Avenatti had lied to the IRS about the amount of money he had made from Tully's Coffee and had lied to the court about his finances. He said Avenatti had \"failed to pay taxes for about four years\" and had \"failed to pay about $3.2 million in taxes and about $1.6 million in trust taxes\" to the IRS.\n\nAvenatti's lawyer, Dean Steward, argued that his client had made mistakes, but had also done a lot of good in his life. He said Avenatti had worked hard, graduating from George Washington University Law School and becoming a successful lawyer in California.\n\nSteward said Avenatti had been the first lawyer to take on Donald Trump and that he had done it pro bono. He said Avenatti had also represented workers at McDonald's in St. Louis who were trying to unionize, and that he had taken on the first case of its kind in the country.\n\nSteward also said Avenatti had been the first lawyer to represent a group of homeless people in Venice, California, who were being evicted from their camp on Terminal Island. He said Avenatti had also attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and had been sober since March 15.\n\nBefore being sentenced, Avenatti apologized to the court and to the victims of his crimes. He said he had been \"a fool\" and that he had made mistakes. He said he had been \"deeply ashamed\" of his actions.\n\nAvenatti had been facing charges in four separate cases in New York, California, the Central District of California and the Southern District of New York. In the New York case, U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman's office accused him of attempting to extort Nike. In the California case, U.S. Attorney Nichola Hanna's office accused him of defrauding Daniels.\n\nIn the Central District case, U.S. Attorney Martin Estrada accused Avenatti of attempting to embezzle money from a client. In the Southern District case, U.S. Attorney Ranee Katzenstein accused Avenatti of attempting to"], ["\r\nCoronavirus-OCDate: 12-08-2022 6:41 PM - Word Count: 760Coronavirus-OC\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 COVID-19 Numbers Keep Zooming Up in Orange County\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 SANTA ANA (CNS) - Orange County's coronavirus case rates and\r\nhospitalizations kept a steady pace up this week with patient levels exceeding\r\nthe summer wave and not seen since mid-February, according to data released\r\ntoday by the Orange County Health Care Agency.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Hospitalizations of COVID-19-infected patients have been on a steady\r\nrise since Nov. 11, when there were 105 patients.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 There were 299 patients as of Nov. 30, and that number has climbed to\r\n388 as of Wednesday. The number of patients in intensive care have mirrored the\r\nsame trend with the number climbing from 38 to 48.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 ``The hospitalization numbers are back to February levels and that is\r\nportentous,'' said Andrew Noymer, an epidemiologist and UC Irvine professor of\r\npopulation health and disease prevention. ``It speaks for itself that we're\r\nback to levels not seen since last winter, the tail end of the Omicron wave,\r\nand we're heading into another winter wave.''\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 As Los Angeles County is weighing another indoor mask mandate, Noymer\r\nrecommended masking up in Orange County.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 ``The best thing people can do is mask in indoor spaces like the mall\r\nor the grocery store,'' Noymer said. ``I really urge people to mask when they\r\ndo their Christmas shopping. Christmas will be more fun if people aren't\r\nsick.''\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 The peak of this summer's wave was on July 2 when there were 350\r\npatients, Noymer noted.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 ``Next week, I predict we'll be back up to January levels or early\r\nFebruary levels. The point is we're moving in the wrong direction.''\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 Noymer noted there has also been a corresponding uptick in RSV and flu\r\nillnesses as well that are burdening hospital staffs.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 ``Nobody knows how long that will persist but RSV impacts children's\r\nhospitals and children's hospitals have been sending some patients to adult\r\nhospitals,'' Noymer said. ``It looks like RSV may have peaked, which is good,\r\nbecause we only so much we can take at a specific time.''\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 It's difficult to say whether the level of COVID-19 patients will\r\nexceed last year's winter wave, but this year hospitals are dealing with a\r\nnational trend of nursing staff shortages, Noymer said.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 ``I think there are staffing shortages affecting Orange County, too,''\r\nNoymer said.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 ``We're also in a situation in which there's a shocking low number of\r\npeople who have taken the bivalent (Omicron) booster,'' Noymer said.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 And many others received vaccines so long ago they may not provide\r\nenough protection to prevent serious illness, he added.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 The number of residents fully vaccinated increased from 2,359,862 to\r\n2,360,871. The number of residents who have received at least one dose is\r\n219,228.
