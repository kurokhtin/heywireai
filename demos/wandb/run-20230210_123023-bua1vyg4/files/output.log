Karen Bass was inaugurated as the 43rd mayor of Los Angeles today, at the Microsoft Theater. Bass, first elected to the Los Angeles City Council in 2007, and re-elected to the council in 2011 and 2015, was sworn in by California Senator Kamala Harris during a ceremony attended by Governor Gavin Newsom.
Bass addressed a crowd of 40,000 Angelenos gathered at City Hall, saying she was humbled to have been chosen as the city's first female African American mayor. She noted that the inauguration marked the 241-year anniversary of the first day of the City of Los Angeles.
The ceremony featured musical performances by Mark Gonzalez, Stevie Wonder, Chloe Bailey, and Las Cafeteras, as well as a poem by Amanda Gorman, the first person to hold the title of Youth Poet Laureate of the United States. Gorman read her poem at the inauguration of President Joe Biden's on Sunday.
Bass, who was elected mayor of Los Angeles on November 8, 2020, also noted that the inauguration was taking place after two months of protests against police brutality and racism in the city.
She said the city had been working on the goals of the protests for the past three years, and that she was looking forward to the next three. Bass said she had already begun to make progress in her first year, including the creation of an Office of Community Safety.
On Sunday, Bass also announced that Los Angeles would be the first major city in the nation to create a Department of Transportation, which will be responsible for making the city more bike and pedestrian friendly.
Bass said she was also looking forward to the next two years, when the city will celebrate its 69th anniversary, and the next three years, when Venice and Fairfax will be celebrating the 50th anniversary of Robert F. Kennedy's assassination in 1968.
Bass noted that the city had made great progress in the past 14 years, including the creation of the Community Coalition in South Los Angeles in 2004, and her election to the California Legislature in 2008, and then to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2010.
She also noted that she had been the first woman to chair the Congressional Black Caucus in 2019, and the first woman to serve as Speaker of the California Assembly in 2020.
Bass said her commitment to the people of Los Angeles was to work hard every day to make the city a better place. She said she was looking forward to the next four years, to making sure that all Angelenos have access to the same opportunities, and to ensuring that the city continues to be a safe and prosperous place to live.

Officials from the Los Angeles Natural History Museum, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, and the National Park Service are planning a memorial hike in Griffith Park to honor the iconic mountain lion P-22.
The hike will take place on Saturday, December 18th, 2022 at 4 p.m. at the Charlie Turner Trailhead, 2840, and will be led by City Councilwoman Nithya Raman's office. The hike will honor the beloved mountain lion that was found dead in Los Angeles several days ago.
Karen Tongson, a spokesperson for the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, said P-22 was found dead in the Hollywood Hills near the Los Angeles Zoo, where he had lived for more than 10 years.
Chuck Bonham, director of the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, said P-22 was estimated to be about 11 or 12 years old when he died. He was first spotted in the Santa Monica Mountains in 2012 and weighed 123 pounds.

The memorial hike is being organized in partnership with the Mountain Lion Foundation, and Gerry Hans, Executive Director of the organization, said it was FoGP that first suggested the idea.
P-22 was first spotted in the Santa Monica Mountains in 2012 and was estimated to be about 11 or 12 years old when he died. He was a beloved mountain lion who was known for his incredible journey from the Santa Monica Mountains to Griffith Park, a distance of about nine miles.

Robert Luna was appointed as the new sheriff of Los Angeles County on Saturday, replacing Jim McDonnell, who held the post for the past four years. Luna, who was previously the Long Beach police chief, was sworn in during a ceremony held at the Hall of Administration in downtown Los Angeles.
The ceremony was attended by more than 18,000 people, including Los Angeles Mayor Alex Villanueva and Long Beach Mayor Robert Garcia. Luna was also joined by Supervisor Holly Mitchell and other county officials.
In his speech, Luna thanked McDonnell for his service to the county and said he was honored to be the first sheriff in roughly a century to come from the Long Beach Police Department. He also thanked the people of Los Angeles County for their support in the Nov. 8 election, when he was elected to the post with more than 60 percent of the vote.
Luna then discussed his plans for the department, which include increasing the number of deputies to more than 18,000 and implementing new tan-and-green uniforms. He also spoke about the need to address police reform in the wake of the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May 2020.
Finally, Luna introduced the new command staff, which includes Jason Skeen, the new chief of Personnel Command, and April Tardy, the new chief of Central Patrol Division. Skeen has been with the department for 28 years, while Tardy has been a part of the department for more than 36 years.
Luna ended his speech by thanking the people of Los Angeles County for their support, and said he was looking forward to the next four years of service.
Michael Avenatti was sentenced to 14 years in prison today by U.S. District Judge James V. Selna in Orange County, California. The sentence is the result of Avenatti's conviction on charges related to his extortion of Nike and defrauding of his former client Stormy Daniels and other clients. The sentence is longer than the five years requested by prosecutors and the 12 months requested by Avenatti's lawyers.
Avenatti, a 51-year-old Newport Beach attorney, was convicted in February of all three counts he faced: honest services wire fraud, extortion and transmission of interstate communications with intent to extort. He was found guilty of attempting to extort Nike for at least $85 million and defrauding Daniels of about $300,000.
At the sentencing hearing in Santa Ana, Selna said Avenatti had committed "a very serious offense" and that "a substantial term of imprisonment is required." He imposed a sentence of 14 years in prison, followed by five years of supervised release.
Avenatti had already been sentenced in the Nike case in New York to three years in prison and in the Daniels case in California to 17 1/2 years, but Selna said he would run the sentences concurrently. This means Avenatti will only serve 14 years, rather than the combined total of about 19 years.
In addition to the prison sentence, Selna ordered Avenatti to pay restitution of $10,810,709 to victims in four separate cases, including the IRS. Avenatti was also ordered to pay a $250,000 fine and to forfeit $2.75 million.
Avenatti had been in custody since last year, when he was arrested in Palm Springs, California, on charges of violating the terms of his release in the New York case. U.S. District Judge Brett Sagel had ordered him to stay in the Southern District of New York, but Avenatti had gone to California.
At the sentencing hearing, Avenatti's lawyer, Alexis Gardner, compared Avenatti to David, the biblical figure who fought Goliath. She said Avenatti had taken on "some of the most powerful Goliaths in the world," including Donald Trump and Nike.
Gardner said Avenatti had been punished enough by the time he'd already served in jail and by the "public humiliation" he had suffered. She asked Selna to sentence Avenatti to only six years in prison.
Avenatti had faced a maximum sentence of 335 years in prison for the three convictions.
Selna said on Monday that he believed Avenatti had a "history of deception" and had "abused the trust of those around him." He noted that Avenatti had failed to pay $8 million in taxes and had failed to pay $12.35 million in restitution to a former client.
The judge also noted that Avenatti had lied to the IRS about the amount of money he had made from Tully's Coffee and had lied to the court about his finances. He said Avenatti had "failed to pay taxes for about four years" and had "failed to pay about $3.2 million in taxes and about $1.6 million in trust taxes" to the IRS.
Avenatti's lawyer, Dean Steward, argued that his client had made mistakes, but had also done a lot of good in his life. He said Avenatti had worked hard, graduating from George Washington University Law School and becoming a successful lawyer in California.
Steward said Avenatti had been the first lawyer to take on Donald Trump and that he had done it pro bono. He said Avenatti had also represented workers at McDonald's in St. Louis who were trying to unionize, and that he had taken on the first case of its kind in the country.
Steward also said Avenatti had been the first lawyer to represent a group of homeless people in Venice, California, who were being evicted from their camp on Terminal Island. He said Avenatti had also attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and had been sober since March 15.
Before being sentenced, Avenatti apologized to the court and to the victims of his crimes. He said he had been "a fool" and that he had made mistakes. He said he had been "deeply ashamed" of his actions.
Avenatti had been facing charges in four separate cases in New York, California, the Central District of California and the Southern District of New York. In the New York case, U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman's office accused him of attempting to extort Nike. In the California case, U.S. Attorney Nichola Hanna's office accused him of defrauding Daniels.
In the Central District case, U.S. Attorney Martin Estrada accused Avenatti of attempting to embezzle money from a client. In the Southern District case, U.S. Attorney Ranee Katzenstein accused Avenatti of attempting to
