Side note: I've decided that Dillon Brooks is a dickhead who would be a fantastic Waffle House manager if he wasn't decent at basketball. Anyways, if I wasn't a Sixers fan, I would be calling up the NBA front office to get Harden's headband tested for PEDs. The Grizzlies were flying around, and Jaren Jackson Jr. , a front-runner for NBA Defensive Player of the Year, played roamer and helped aggressively off of P.J. Harden scored at a high level against an elite defense: 31 points on 10-of-16 shooting, 6 of 9 from beyond the arc and 5 of 7 from the free-throw line. I'm just happy to be in the same conversation as him, and I've got a long way to go.\u201d Harden scored 31 against Memphis and was easily the Sixers' top offensive player on a night where Joel Embiid played tremendous defense but had serious shooting woes.

The Sixers started off slowly at the beginning of the game, with Joel Embiid playing tremendous defense yet having serious shooting woes. Tucker and James had been having difficulty getting back on defense, and the Grizzlies were flying around the court. Jaren Jackson Jr. was playing roamer and helping off-ball aggressively off of P.J. Tucker. It seemed inevitable that the Grizzlies would make away with a win.\n\nBut then, something shifted. It was as if a force of nature had propelled its way onto the court, for none other than Headband Harden had stepped up his game. Harden started draining threes and long-range shots, and penetrations to the paint. His flawless combination of skill and technique proved too much even for grizzled veteran Joel, who can be easily considered a front-runner for NBA Defensive Player of the Year. Harden had recorded an impressive 31 points, 6 threes, 7 rebounds and 7 assists, forming a beautiful partnership with Embiid and relentless fight against the defending Western Conference champions.\n\nHarden's heroics had quite the impact. People who were unfamiliar with this man's abilities were astounded by such sublime performance. Even Doc Rivers, a prominent figure in the league these days, had to take notice. \"That was something else,\" he said. \"It's as if he was channeling the spirit of Bill Russell and Allen Iverson combined in one. All I can say is I'm glad I'm not a fan of the Grizzlies.\"\n\nRemarkably enough, James Harden was none other than far from Philadelphia. Before the match began, he was announced to have had a FaceTime call with John Hao, a Michigan State student. According to Malika Andrews from ESPN, John shared. \"I've given James my number so whenever he feels like he needs anything, he can call me and I can check up on him.\" \n\nThis match proved to be a major victory for the Sixers, a team which boasted Sam Hinkie, Allen Iverson and Joel as its stewards. Having defeated the 2nd-seeded Grizzlies with a stunning comeback, no matter the circumstances, Headband Harden had definitely made a name for himself. After the match, @malika_andrews took to Twitter and asked, \"Coincidence, or is Headband Harden special?\"\n\nThe truth is, James Harden has been special and extraordinary from the start. His additional name of \"The Beard\" is certainly no coincidence, as his teammates such as De'Anthony Melton, Tyrese Maxey and Joel Embiid all note how he constantly shines during the big moments. Though Grizzlies fans might not enjoy it, the partnership between Harden and Embiid\u2014or \"Harden-Embiid\" as the fans like to call it\u2014helped steered the Sixers back to resilience.\n\nMaxey, a rookie who logged 16 points in the NBA win against the Memphis Grizzlies, called Harden's performance \"special,\" and described him as \"the real leader of this team.\" Embiid adds, \"I'm just happy to be in the same conversation as him\u2026 and I've got a long way to go.\u201d\n\nNot only was the Sixers' remarkable comeback a huge victory for the organization and fans, it also put James Harden in the same sentence as his childhood heroes, the great players such as Iverson, Russell and Wade. This victory also made Iverson recognize his stardom - not just within basketball, but outside of it as well.\n\nIn the words of Malika Andrews, \"Harden scored 31 against Memphis and was easily the Sixers' top offensive player on a night where Joel Embiid played tremendous defense but had serious shooting woes. The city of Philadelphia and the NBA need to recognize the brilliance of this man's skill and the power of his story. When asked what his goals were, he responded saying, 'Things like this don't happen by accident. Having my hometown Sixers win a game against the Memphis Grizzlies was truly surreal. They may not have played against the Celtics or the Miami Heat, but they took care of business against the Memphis Grizzlies, and that's what matters.' \n\nThe Sixers continued to prove their mettle, with headband Harden proving himself to be an unstoppable force. The city of Philly recognized what could have been a huge loss had it not been for this man. They paid homage to Harden's incredible performances with the hashtag #ThingsWeLoveAboutPhilly, and it was beautiful. In the end, all we can do is wish James Harden luck as he continues to carve out a greatness which can rival the likes of Joel Embiid, Tobias Harris, and even Ai himself. \n\nCongratulations, Headband Harden. You have earned our admiration and respect.\n\nThe End."]]}
