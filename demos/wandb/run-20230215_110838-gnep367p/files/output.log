The Colombian National Air Defense System had been tracking the mysterious white observation balloon for days until it finally left the country's airspace on Monday. The balloon, which was of Chinese origin, had apparently "seriously deviated" from its planned course and entered the skies across Latin America and the Caribbean due to bad weather and limited control ability over the craft, according to Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning. President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela had recently proposed establishing a new international bloc of Latin American and Caribbean countries, and had even referred to Presidents Xi Jinping of China and Vladimir V. Putin of Russia as each being an "older brother."
The Colombian Air Force, as well as Costa Rica's Civil Aviation Authority, both confirmed that a white observation balloon had been tracked in their airspace last week, though they didn't attribute it to any specific country or nation. US President Joe Biden had first approved the plan to shoot the balloon down on Wednesday, but decided to wait until it was over the water to avoid putting people on the ground in danger.
Divers with the US Navy began attempting to recover the wreckage of the balloon on Saturday after it was shot down by US military jets near Surfside Beach, South Carolina. Venezuelan officials condemned the US decision to shoot down the balloon, insisting that America was using force instead of treating the situation with the seriousness it deserved. Venezuelan Foreign Affairs Minister, Elda Cantú, stated that the attack was a "flagrant violation of international law."
The Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Mao Ning, told reporters that the balloon had “deviated greatly” from its intended route and the US was informed of their understanding of the situation. The balloon had not posed any risks or threats to any of the countries it had passed through. In an official statement, the Venezuelan government said it "strongly rejects the US's attack on the Chinese civilian aircraft."
