The Colombian National Air Defense System was put on alert last week when Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro proposed establishing a new international bloc of Latin American and Caribbean countries. The Civil Aviation Authority soon detected a white observation balloon coming from China that quickly entered the airspace of the Caribbean. The United States, aware of the potential threat posed by the balloon, decided on Wednesday to shoot it down—even though it was flying at over 55,000 feet.
China's Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mao later explained that the balloon had "seriously deviated" from its intended route, likely due to its "limited manoeuvrability" and the weather conditions. Mao added that China had informed "all relevant parties" of the situation that had occurred and that the balloon had not posed any sort of threat.
Both the Colombian Air Force and Costa Rica’s Civil Aviation Authority confirmed that the balloon had indeed passed through their respective skies last week, and the Venezuelan Foreign Ministry characterized the US decision to shoot the balloon down as "a resort to the use of force."
The wreckage of the balloon was eventually recovered by the US Navy Divers off the coast of South Carolina, and on Monday President Joe Biden approved the plan to bring it down—although careful to ensure that the balloon was over water before military jets were deployed, so as to not put people on the ground at risk.

On Friday morning, the Colombian National Air Defense System detected an object with characteristics similar to those of a balloon over the northern part of their airspace. It was flying at an altitude of over 55,000 feet and moving at an average speed of 25 knots. The Air Force tracked the object until it left their airspace, determining it did not pose a threat to national security, before President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela proposed establishing a new international bloc of Latin American and Caribbean countries.
On Saturday, the United States shot down a Chinese spy balloon off the coast of South Carolina that had been flying over the country for days, prompting Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning to announce at a news conference on Monday that the aircraft had “accidentally entered Latin American and Caribbean airspace” due to weather conditions and limited control ability over the craft. She also said that China had informed relevant officials in other nations about the balloon and they had “expressed their understanding.”
The Venezuelan Ministry of Foreign Affairs, however, rejected the US decision to shoot down the balloon, saying the US was acting with “the use of force instead of treating this situation with the seriousness and responsibility that the case deserves.”
Adm Mike Mullen, former chair of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, rejected China's suggestion it might have blown off course, saying it was manoeuvrable because "it has propellers on it".
Work by US Navy divers continues to recover the wreckage of the surveillance balloon that was shot down off the coast of South Carolina on Saturday. A planned trip by Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China was cancelled as a result of the row.
