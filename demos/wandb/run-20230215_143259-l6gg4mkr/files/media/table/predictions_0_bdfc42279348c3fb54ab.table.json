Please make sure the story you generate is at least 500 words long.\nOriginal example: The emergency declaration will ``recognize the severity of our crisis and break new ground to maximize our ability to urgently move people inside, and do so for good. Sunday's ceremony was initially scheduled to take place outside City Hall, but rain in the forecast led to a venue shift indoors. Surprise performers at the inauguration included Stevie Wonder, who sang ``Keep Our Love Alive'' and ``Living for the City,'' and Chloe Bailey and Las Cafeteras. Amanda Gorman, the first National Youth Poet Laureate, who also delivered a poem at President Joe Biden's inauguration, said in her reading Sunday that ``the time of never before is officially past.'' Bass' father fled the Jim Crow south during the great African American migration after World War II and found work as a letter carrier. ``When I think about the dreams of working people today, I reflect on the fact that my mother and father were able to buy a home in Los Angeles for their family of six with one paycheck,'' Bass said. Bass' organizing career began in 1990 when she founded Community Coalition, a South Los Angeles social justice group in response to the crack cocaine crisis. State Senate President pro-Tempore Toni Atkins said that Bass didn't run for mayor for ``credit or photo-opps.''Kamala Harris to swear in Karen Bass as first female mayor of Los Angeles Vice President Kamala Harris will swear in Karen Bass as the 43rd mayor of Los Angeles in an inauguration ceremony on Sunday in a meeting of two Democratic women who have broken barriers in politics. Bass alluded to her history of firsts shortly after winning her race when she told reporters that the accomplishment of becoming the first female mayor of Los Angeles was still \u201csinking in.\u201d \u201cWhen you\u2019re in a position like this \u2013 and I was in a similar position when I was sworn in as speaker \u2013 it means that you have extra responsibility. \u201cThe path that you go is laying the foundation for those that come behind you.\u201d After her victory, Bass promised to solve the homelessness crisis in the nation\u2019s second-largest city. \u201cShe is holding her inaugural ceremony on Sunday to make it easier for Angelenos to attend and to ensure her first day as mayor is dedicated to bringing unhoused Angelenos inside and making our city safer and more livable for all,\u201d the mayor-elect\u2019s office said in a statement announcing the ceremony. The six-term congresswoman, who currently represents South and West Los Angeles, defeated real estate developer Rick Caruso in the general election last month. During her campaign, Bass leaned into her experience bringing together Black and Latino community organizers in South Los Angeles in the early 1990s to address the root causes of crime and the crack epidemic. She was able to put together a winning coalition of Black voters in South Los Angeles and White progressives on the city\u2019s west side to help overcome Caruso\u2019s spending. The mayor-elect began her career as a physician assistant in the emergency room in Los Angeles County.The ceremony was initially scheduled to take place outside of City Hall, but due to the rain, was moved indoors. Ready to get down to business, Bass said she would spend her first day in office declaring a state of emergency on the homeless issue plaguing the city. \"I will start my first day as mayor at the city's emergency operations centers, where my first act as mayor will be to declare a state of emergency on homelessness,\" Bass said, noting that she will \"recognize the severity of our crisis and break new ground to maximize our ability to urgently move people inside, and do so for good.\" Dozens of prominent politicians were in attendance for the inauguration, including California State Senate President pro-tempore Toni Atkins, Los Angeles County Democratic Party Chairman Mark Gonzalez and Governor Gavin Newsom. Bass, 69, was a social worker and community activist before representing Los Angeles in the state Assembly for six years, where she also served as the first African American speaker. Council President Paul Krekorian spoke at the event, predicting that Bass is just the leader the city of Los Angeles needs to bring people together. He now awaits further plans pending his nomination to become U.S. ambassador to India, which has hit a snag due to opposition from some on Senate, concerned with sexual misconduct allegations against a former Garcetti staff member. Bass was named mayor-elect in November after a close race with her competitor Rick Caruso, the billionaire developer who spent more than $100 million on his campaign.\n Entities: - 69: DATE\n- 241-year: DATE\n- african american: NORP\n- 2022: DATE\n- city council: ORG\n- fairfax: GPE\n- daily: DATE\n- five: CARDINAL\n- bass: PERSON\n- first: ORDINAL\n- monday: DATE\n- la: GPE\n- six: CARDINAL\n- toni atkins: PERSON\n- city hall: FAC\n- robert f. kennedy's: PERSON\n- world war ii: EVENT\n- los angeles: GPE\n- the jim crow: ORG\n- one: CARDINAL\n- three: CARDINAL\n- nearly a decade: DATE\n- 17,000: CARDINAL\n- sunday: DATE\n- l.a.: GPE\n- 14: DATE\n- the congressional black caucus: ORG\n- 8:50 pm: TIME\n- nov. 8: DATE\n- chloe bailey: PERSON\n- living for the city: WORK_OF_ART\n- 1968: DATE\n- angelenos: PERSON\n- stevie wonder: PERSON\n- 2013: DATE\n- the u.s. house: ORG\n- 40,000: CARDINAL\n- every month: DATE\n- joe biden's: PERSON\n- cns: ORG\n- 9 a.m.: TIME\n- assembly: ORG\n- friday: DATE\n- her first\r\nyear: DATE\n- the los angeles county democratic party: ORG\n- two: CARDINAL\n- october\r\n2021: DATE\n- los\r\nangeles: GPE\n- today: DATE\n- de le\u00f3n: PERSON\n- krekorian: PERSON\n- city news service: ORG\n- evening: TIME\n- 3rd: ORDINAL\n- mark gonzalez: PERSON\n- rick caruso: PERSON\n- keep our love: WORK_OF_ART\n- atkins: PERSON\n- paul krekorian: PERSON\n- 2010: DATE\n- 7th: ORDINAL\n- lax: ORG\n- 1990: DATE\n- city\r\nhall: FAC\n- gorman: PERSON\n- 2019: DATE\n- a day: DATE\n- legislature: ORG\n- the los\r\nangeles city council: ORG\n- amanda gorman: PERSON\n- 12: CARDINAL\n- venice: GPE\n- eric he\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 city news service: PERSON\n- councilman kevin de\r\nle\u00f3n: PERSON\n- california: GPE\n- bass inauguration: PERSON\n- new city: GPE\n- an office of community\r\nsafety: ORG\n- hold news conference\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 eds: ORG\n- community\r\ncoalition: ORG\n- senate: ORG\n- gavin newsom: PERSON\n- eric garcetti: PERSON\n- four years later: DATE\n- second: ORDINAL\n- kamala harris: PERSON\n- the microsoft theater: ORG\n- 2004: DATE\n\nBegin story:", {"prompt_tokens": 1650, "completion_tokens": 740, "total_tokens": 2390}, "\nIt was just days before Karen Bass' mayoral inauguration ceremony when the Los Angeles City council voted to make her the first female mayor of the City of Los Angeles. The 69-year-old Bass had first broken into politics nearly a decade before as a member of the California State legislature, representing the Los Angeles County. On Sunday, January 14, 2022, history would be made as she became the 43rd mayor of Los Angeles.\n\nThe ceremony was scheduled to take place at City Hall, but due to bad weather it was shifted indoors to the Microsoft Theater. A confirmed list of guests included Vice President Kamala Harris who swore in Bass as mayor, California State Senate President pro-Tempore Toni Atkins, Los Angeles County Democratic Party Chair Mark Gonzalez, and Governor Gavin Newsom. Bass was not alone in making history, however\u2013 Amanda Gorman, first National Youth Poet Laureate, made a surprise appearance and said, \u201cThe time of never before is officially past.\u201d\n\nAs her story is intertwined with the city of Los Angeles and an epic fight against poverty and addiction, Bass took this time to honor and reflect on her roots and the legacy of civil rights leaders such as Robert F. Kennedy and Rev. Martin Luther King.\n\n\"My father fled the Jim Crow South during the great African American migration after World War II and found work as a letter carrier,\u201d Bass said at the ceremony. \u201cWhen I think about the dreams of working people today, I reflect on the fact that my mother and father were able to buy a home in Los Angeles for their family of six with one paycheck.\" \n\nBass's career in politics began in 1990 when she founded the Community Coalition, a South Los Angeles-based social justice group in response to the crack cocaine crisis. She soon after became a member of the state legislature, and served as the first African American Speaker of the Assembly from 2004 to 2010.\n\nIn 2013, Bass was chosen as the 3rd female member of the L.A. Congressional Delegation and was elected to serve in the U.S. House. During her time in Congress, Bass was a member of the prestigious Congressional Black Caucus, joining Councilman Kevin de Le\u00f3n, Council President Paul Krekorian, Congresswoman Janice Hahn, Congresswoman Judy Chu, and Congresswoman Lucille Roybal-Allard. \n\nBass was elected mayor-elect of Los Angeles in November of 2021, toppling her competitor Rick Caruso in a close race. She ran on a platform to solve the homelessness crisis in the nation's second-largest city and declared a state of emergency on her first day in office. She laid out her plans for the city during her inaugural address, which was largely focused on her commitment to taking action on targeted issues.\n\n\"I will start my first day as mayor at the city's emergency operations center, where my first act as mayor will be to declare a state of emergency on homelessness,\" she said. \" that's why I'm here. To make sure that everyone, everyone, everyone... everyone has a chance in Los Angeles. Everyone has a chance for an education, for affordable housing, for access to healthcare, for a safe and secure neighborhood, for jobs that pay a living wage, and for dignity, security, and opportunity.\" \n\nShe ended her speech on an optimistic note, vowing that while the task of getting the city back on its feet is a daunting one, it is not impossible.

The inauguration, which was originally going to be held outside City Hall, was moved indoors due to rain but that didn\u2019t dampen the festive spirit of the day. A large crowd gathered to witness the special occasion, including prominent politicians such as California State Senate President pro-tempore Toni Atkins, Los Angeles County Democratic Party Chairman Mark Gonzalez, Governor Gavin Newsom, and Kamala Harris.\n\nMayor-elect Bass began her career in 1990 as a physician assistant in the emergency room at a Los Angeles County hospital. But it was her founding of the South Los Angeles social justice organization, Community Coalition, in response to the crack cocaine crisis that really had an impact. This experience of bringing together Black and Latino community organizers to tackle the root causes of crime and drug addiction in the city established her as a leader in local politics.\n\nIn 2002, Bass began her first term in the California State Assembly, where she eventually became the first African American Speaker. Four years later she was elected to the Los Angeles City Council, where she served for six years, before running for mayor. During her campaign she honed in on her experience from nearly a decade prior to bring social justice to South Los Angeles. Her hard work was rewarded when she was elected to office in the historic November 8, 2020 election, beating out her competitors City Councilman Kevin De Le\u00f3n, incumbent Mayor Eric Garcetti, and Paul Kerkorain. \n\nAt 8:50 pm on Sunday, March 14th, 2021, that hard work paid off. Bass was sworn into office at the Microsoft Theater in what had been planned to be an outdoor ceremony in front of City Hall. Along with her were her fellow Angelenos, speakers like former State Senator Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., and first National Youth Poet Laureate, Amanda Gorman. \n\nGorman, who had read her own poem at President Joe Biden\u2019s inauguration in January, was delighted to be part of the celebration. \u201cThe time of never before is officially past,\u201d she read with emotion. Bass and Gorman were joined by singer Chloe Bailey who performed a soulful rendition of Stevie Wonder\u2019s Living for the City and Keep Our Love from 1968. This was followed by Eds from LAX who rapped, and over 40,000 people watched the live stream of the event.\n\nFriends, family, and political figures alike came to celebrate the inaugural of Bass\u2019 first year in office, and the Los Angeles County Democratic Party Chairman, Mark Gonzalez, presented Bass with a rose, calling it a \u201ctoken of the admiration we have for you.\u201d Governor Gavin Newsom also attended the swearing in ceremony, and Rick Caruso, the CEO of the real estate firm Caruso Affiliated, presented Bass with the keys to New City, a real estate development currently in development.\n\nDue to Mayor Bass\u2019 work earlier in her career to bring together Black and Latino Angelenos to address the root causes of crime and the crack epidemic, Los Angeles City Council President Nury Martinez set in motion the Office of Community Safety and issued a memorandum noting that 17,000 people had been employed as a direct result of the organization\u2019s actions. In addition, Martinez and members of the Congressional Black Caucus, have sought to commemorate the momentous occasion by launching the\u201cBass Inauguration\u201d, a campaign that involves the donation of more than 1,200 meals every month to support Black and Latino families, something that Bass herself supported during her campaign.\n\nOne can\u2019t help but think of Robert F. Kennedy\u2019s famous quote \u201cA small act of kindness can change the world\u201d. It\u2019s this sentiment that has underpinned Sharon Bass\u2019 work and continues to guide her as mayor of Los Angeles. The city of Los Angeles has come a long way since its beginnings back in 2019, and there is still much to be done. The day marked the official beginning of a new chapter for the City of Angels and for Mayor Bass, one that is sure to be filled with continued effort and compassion for her fellow Angelenos."]]}
