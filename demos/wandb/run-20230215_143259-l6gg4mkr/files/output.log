It was just days before Karen Bass' mayoral inauguration ceremony when the Los Angeles City council voted to make her the first female mayor of the City of Los Angeles. The 69-year-old Bass had first broken into politics nearly a decade before as a member of the California State legislature, representing the Los Angeles County. On Sunday, January 14, 2022, history would be made as she became the 43rd mayor of Los Angeles.
The ceremony was scheduled to take place at City Hall, but due to bad weather it was shifted indoors to the Microsoft Theater. A confirmed list of guests included Vice President Kamala Harris who swore in Bass as mayor, California State Senate President pro-Tempore Toni Atkins, Los Angeles County Democratic Party Chair Mark Gonzalez, and Governor Gavin Newsom. Bass was not alone in making history, however– Amanda Gorman, first National Youth Poet Laureate, made a surprise appearance and said, “The time of never before is officially past.”
As her story is intertwined with the city of Los Angeles and an epic fight against poverty and addiction, Bass took this time to honor and reflect on her roots and the legacy of civil rights leaders such as Robert F. Kennedy and Rev. Martin Luther King.
"My father fled the Jim Crow South during the great African American migration after World War II and found work as a letter carrier,” Bass said at the ceremony. “When I think about the dreams of working people today, I reflect on the fact that my mother and father were able to buy a home in Los Angeles for their family of six with one paycheck."
Bass's career in politics began in 1990 when she founded the Community Coalition, a South Los Angeles-based social justice group in response to the crack cocaine crisis. She soon after became a member of the state legislature, and served as the first African American Speaker of the Assembly from 2004 to 2010.
In 2013, Bass was chosen as the 3rd female member of the L.A. Congressional Delegation and was elected to serve in the U.S. House. During her time in Congress, Bass was a member of the prestigious Congressional Black Caucus, joining Councilman Kevin de León, Council President Paul Krekorian, Congresswoman Janice Hahn, Congresswoman Judy Chu, and Congresswoman Lucille Roybal-Allard.
Bass was elected mayor-elect of Los Angeles in November of 2021, toppling her competitor Rick Caruso in a close race. She ran on a platform to solve the homelessness crisis in the nation's second-largest city and declared a state of emergency on her first day in office. She laid out her plans for the city during her inaugural address, which was largely focused on her commitment to taking action on targeted issues.
"I will start my first day as mayor at the city's emergency operations center, where my first act as mayor will be to declare a state of emergency on homelessness," she said. " that's why I'm here. To make sure that everyone, everyone, everyone... everyone has a chance in Los Angeles. Everyone has a chance for an education, for affordable housing, for access to healthcare, for a safe and secure neighborhood, for jobs that pay a living wage, and for dignity, security, and opportunity."
She ended her speech on an optimistic note, vowing that while the task of getting the city back on its feet is a daunting one, it is not impossible. As Bass begins her term as mayor, it's clear that Los Angeles is ready to make history under her leadership.

It was a historic day for Los Angeles on Monday as Sharon Bass, 69, was sworn in as the city’s first female Black mayor. The inauguration, which was originally going to be held outside City Hall, was moved indoors due to rain but that didn’t dampen the festive spirit of the day. A large crowd gathered to witness the special occasion, including prominent politicians such as California State Senate President pro-tempore Toni Atkins, Los Angeles County Democratic Party Chairman Mark Gonzalez, Governor Gavin Newsom, and Kamala Harris.
Mayor-elect Bass began her career in 1990 as a physician assistant in the emergency room at a Los Angeles County hospital. But it was her founding of the South Los Angeles social justice organization, Community Coalition, in response to the crack cocaine crisis that really had an impact. This experience of bringing together Black and Latino community organizers to tackle the root causes of crime and drug addiction in the city established her as a leader in local politics.
In 2002, Bass began her first term in the California State Assembly, where she eventually became the first African American Speaker. Four years later she was elected to the Los Angeles City Council, where she served for six years, before running for mayor. During her campaign she honed in on her experience from nearly a decade prior to bring social justice to South Los Angeles. Her hard work was rewarded when she was elected to office in the historic November 8, 2020 election, beating out her competitors City Councilman Kevin De León, incumbent Mayor Eric Garcetti, and Paul Kerkorain.
At 8:50 pm on Sunday, March 14th, 2021, that hard work paid off. Bass was sworn into office at the Microsoft Theater in what had been planned to be an outdoor ceremony in front of City Hall. Along with her were her fellow Angelenos, speakers like former State Senator Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., and first National Youth Poet Laureate, Amanda Gorman.
Gorman, who had read her own poem at President Joe Biden’s inauguration in January, was delighted to be part of the celebration. “The time of never before is officially past,” she read with emotion. Bass and Gorman were joined by singer Chloe Bailey who performed a soulful rendition of Stevie Wonder’s Living for the City and Keep Our Love from 1968. This was followed by Eds from LAX who rapped, and over 40,000 people watched the live stream of the event.
Friends, family, and political figures alike came to celebrate the inaugural of Bass’ first year in office, and the Los Angeles County Democratic Party Chairman, Mark Gonzalez, presented Bass with a rose, calling it a “token of the admiration we have for you.” Governor Gavin Newsom also attended the swearing in ceremony, and Rick Caruso, the CEO of the real estate firm Caruso Affiliated, presented Bass with the keys to New City, a real estate development currently in development.
Due to Mayor Bass’ work earlier in her career to bring together Black and Latino Angelenos to address the root causes of crime and the crack epidemic, Los Angeles City Council President Nury Martinez set in motion the Office of Community Safety and issued a memorandum noting that 17,000 people had been employed as a direct result of the organization’s actions. In addition, Martinez and members of the Congressional Black Caucus, have sought to commemorate the momentous occasion by launching the“Bass Inauguration”, a campaign that involves the donation of more than 1,200 meals every month to support Black and Latino families, something that Bass herself supported during her campaign.
One can’t help but think of Robert F. Kennedy’s famous quote “A small act of kindness can change the world”. It’s this sentiment that has underpinned Sharon Bass’ work and continues to guide her as mayor of Los Angeles. The city of Los Angeles has come a long way since its beginnings back in 2019, and there is still much to be done. The day marked the official beginning of a new chapter for the City of Angels and for Mayor Bass, one that is sure to be filled with continued effort and compassion for her fellow Angelenos.
