It had all started the Wednesday morning, when military personnel from the Colombian National Air Defense System first tracked a white observation balloon soaring through the skies at a height of over 55,000 feet. The Colombian authorities alerted the Civil Aviation Authority in neighboring Costa Rica, who were quick to take on the responsibility of monitoring the air-borne craft and reporting its trajectory when it came within a few miles of their own airspace.
For the better part of the week, the balloon’s journey remained largely unrestricted and unquestioned. That was until last Friday morning, when the US Joint Chiefs of Staff took note and identified the mysterious vessel as a Chinese craft. There had been simmering tensions between China and the United States over both economic and political issues that had reached another boiling point due to the US’s decision to enforce sanctions on Chinese companies in the lead up to the next Cold War.
Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning was quick to respond to the US’s accusations. In a news conference on Monday she explained that the balloon had “seriously deviated” from its planned course, citing the limited control ability over the craft due to unfavorable weather conditions. Furthermore, the spokeswoman added that China had “informed all relevant parties and appropriately handled the situation, which did not pose any threats to any countries.” This was quickly backed up by statements from the Colombian Air Force, the Venezuelan Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Costa Rican Civil Aviation Authority, all of whom had tracked the object and explicitly stated that it posed no danger to national security.
The following day, US President Joe Biden authorized the shooting down of the craft, despite vehement protests from its creator, Chinese President Xi Jinping. In a statement released by the White House, military advisor Admiral Mike Mullen declared the craft to have been on a clear mission to perform surveillance of US airspace and thus posed a direct threat to national security.
But late Sunday night, Venezuela’s President Nicolás Maduro, who had only recently proposed establishing a new international bloc of Latin American and Caribbean countries, strongly condemned the US’s decision to bring down the balloon, claiming that the US government had “once again resorted to the use of force, instead of treating this situation with the seriousness and responsibility that the case deserves.” He further referred to the Presidents Xi Jinping of China and Vladimir V. Putin of Russia as the “older brothers”, implying an even stronger alliance between the three countries than ever before.
The White House, however, remained adamant in its stance that the incident had required military action for the safety and security of the US. “Given the nature of the observation craft,” stated White House Press Secretary Elda Cantú, “and the lack of a response from the Beijing government, the President made the decision to cause it no harm and ensure that it be safely taken out of the air by Navy divers near the coast of Mexico City.”
So, on the morning of February 4th, 2023, US Navy divers showed up to the site of the shooting 3 days earlier, near the town of Surfside Beach in South Carolina, and began their task of recovering the wreckage of the surveillance balloon. What began as the white observation balloon soaring through the skies above the Caribbean and Latin America, had now been brought to an abrupt end.

On Saturday, the Colombian National Air Defense System detected a mysterious object entering the northern part of its airspace. The object had characteristics similar to a balloon and was moving at an altitude of over 55,000 feet and an average speed of 25 knots. Colombia immediately contacted its neighbor countries of Latin America and the Caribbean to notify them of the object, prompting the United States to take action and shoot down the suspected Chinese spy balloon.
The incident did not go unnoticed by Nicolás Maduro, the President of Venezuela, who quickly proposed a new international bloc of Latin American and Caribbean countries with Xi Jinping of China and Vladimir V. Putin of Russia as "older brothers". A spokeswoman for China's foreign ministry, Mao Ning, chimed in as well, telling reporters at a news conference that the Chinese government had informed relevant officials about the balloon before it entered Latin American airspace, and that the U.S. had a clear “overreaction” to the situation.
Fast forward to Monday, Mao confirmed that the balloon was indeed of Chinese origin, as it had "seriously deviated" from its planned course and entered the airspace of Latin America and the Caribbean “by mistake” due to weather conditions and limited control ability over the craft. She also reaffirmed that the balloon "did not pose any threats to any countries".
The U.S. government soon responded with full force, as President Joe Biden had approved the plan to shoot down the balloon as early as Wednesday, with the intention to do so when it was over water in order to avoid putting people on the ground at risk. Adm Mike Mullen of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff quickly rejected China's suggestion that it might have blown off course, pointing out that it has "propellers on it".
The wreckage of the balloon continued to be collected by US Navy divers over the weekend, while a planned trip by Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China was canceled due to the escalating tension between the two countries. Costa Rica's Civil Aviation Authority and the Colombian Air Force both confirmed that a white observation balloon similar to the one spotted over the US was tracked in their airspace last week, though they did not attribute the vessel to China.
Given the opportunity, the Venezuelan Ministry of Foreign Affairs was quick to criticize the US, saying “Once again, the United States resorts to the use of force, instead of treating this situation with the seriousness and responsibility that the case deserves”.
It wasn't until later on Monday that Beijing admitted the aircraft had "accidentally entered Latin American and Caribbean airspace", and Mao made it clear that China abides by international law and did not pose any threats to any countries with the balloon. She also expressed her disappointment with the U.S.'s "clear overreaction" to the situation.
Since then, the U.S. government has been unable to comment on the matter, due to the rising tensions between the two countries. Even as of today, we can only look to China and Latin America for news about the situation, as the U.S. continues to gather information and analyze the incident.
