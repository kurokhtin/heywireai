The Colombian authorities alerted the Civil Aviation Authority in neighboring Costa Rica, who were quick to take on the responsibility of monitoring the air-borne craft and reporting its trajectory when it came within a few miles of their own airspace. \n\nFor the better part of the week, the balloon\u2019s journey remained largely unrestricted and unquestioned. That was until last Friday morning, when the US Joint Chiefs of Staff took note and identified the mysterious vessel as a Chinese craft. There had been simmering tensions between China and the United States over both economic and political issues that had reached another boiling point due to the US\u2019s decision to enforce sanctions on Chinese companies in the lead up to the next Cold War. \n\nChinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning was quick to respond to the US\u2019s accusations. In a news conference on Monday she explained that the balloon had \u201cseriously deviated\u201d from its planned course, citing the limited control ability over the craft due to unfavorable weather conditions. Furthermore, the spokeswoman added that China had \u201cinformed all relevant parties and appropriately handled the situation, which did not pose any threats to any countries.\u201d This was quickly backed up by statements from the Colombian Air Force, the Venezuelan Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Costa Rican Civil Aviation Authority, all of whom had tracked the object and explicitly stated that it posed no danger to national security. \n\nThe following day, US President Joe Biden authorized the shooting down of the craft, despite vehement protests from its creator, Chinese President Xi Jinping. In a statement released by the White House, military advisor Admiral Mike Mullen declared the craft to have been on a clear mission to perform surveillance of US airspace and thus posed a direct threat to national security. \n\nBut late Sunday night, Venezuela\u2019s President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who had only recently proposed establishing a new international bloc of Latin American and Caribbean countries, strongly condemned the US\u2019s decision to bring down the balloon, claiming that the US government had \u201conce again resorted to the use of force, instead of treating this situation with the seriousness and responsibility that the case deserves.\u201d He further referred to the Presidents Xi Jinping of China and Vladimir V. Putin of Russia as the \u201colder brothers\u201d, implying an even stronger alliance between the three countries than ever before.\n\nThe White House, however, remained adamant in its stance that the incident had required military action for the safety and security of the US. \u201cGiven the nature of the observation craft,\u201d stated White House Press Secretary Elda Cant\u00fa, \u201cand the lack of a response from the Beijing government, the President made the decision to cause it no harm and ensure that it be safely taken out of the air by Navy divers near the coast of Mexico City.\u201d \n\nSo, on the morning of February 4th, 2023, US Navy divers showed up to the site of the shooting 3 days earlier, near the town of Surfside Beach in South Carolina, and began their task of recovering the wreckage of the surveillance balloon. What began as the white observation balloon soaring through the skies above the Caribbean and Latin America, had now been brought to an abrupt end."], [["https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/06/world/americas/chinese-balloon-latin-america-colombia.html", "https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/06/asia/china-balloon-latin-america-intl/index.html", "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-64537098"], "Generate a story that involves the following entities and origin example.
