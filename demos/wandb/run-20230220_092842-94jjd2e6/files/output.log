 The Chinese government has confirmed that a balloon was seen floating over Latin America and the Caribbean on Friday and was being used for civilian purposes, such as flight tests. Colombia's National Air Defense System spotted the object in its airspace and determined it had "characteristics similar to those of a balloon" before it left the country. The U.S. then shot down a Chinese spy balloon floating off the coast of South Carolina on Saturday. Venezuela condemned the attack as the U.S. had not approached the situation with seriousness. China informed relevant officials in other nations of the balloon and they expressed understanding, while the spokesperson for China's foreign ministry has said the US had an "overreaction".
