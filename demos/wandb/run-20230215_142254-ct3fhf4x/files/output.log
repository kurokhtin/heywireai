At the beginning of February, tensions were rising between nations in the Americas. In spite of various diplomatic attempts to avoid conflict, President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela made the surprise announcement that he was proposing the creation of a new international bloc of Latin American and Caribbean countries. In his historic speech to the Venezuelan people, he referred to Presidents Xi Jinping of China and Vladimir V. Putin of Russia as "older brothers."
It was in this atmosphere that a Chinese observation balloon made an unexpected appearance in the skies over Latin America and the Caribbean. Last Wednesday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning held a news conference to inform the world about the incident. According to Mao, the balloon had been sent aloft by the Chinese government with the aim of conducting aerial surveillance and had been equipped with limited steering capability. Unfortunately, due to extreme weather and the balloon's inadequate steering capabilities, it had "deviated greatly" from its intended route and entered the airspace of other nations.
One of the countries it passed over was Colombia. On Saturday, the Colombian Air Force tracked the object until it left the country's airspace, determining that it did not pose any threat of national security. As a precautionary measure, the Colombian national air defense system was placed on high alert and citizens were warned to remain vigilant.
China extended an apology to Colombia as well as all other affected countries. The Venezuelan Ministry of Foreign Affairs - referring to the US decision to shoot down a similar balloon over their airspace - released a statement saying they "reject the attack by the United States against a civilian unmanned aircraft of Chinese origin." President Maduro, who had recently taken the podium in Caracas, strongly condemned the incident.
Meanwhile, in the US, concerns about the balloon were gaining traction. By Monday, the US military had approved a plan to bring it down and had been eagerly awaiting its descent into US airspace over South Carolina. On Saturday, the US Navy divers began recovery efforts to bring the balloon safely down. But it couldn't be done without risk, which is why the US Joint Chiefs of Staff approved the plan to shoot down the balloon while it was still over water and away from populated areas.
By Sunday, President Joe Biden had made his decision and the balloon had been shot down - but it was too late. Not only was the balloon shot down off the coast of South Carolina, it was also the same balloon Venezuelans had witnessed passing through their airspace a few days prior.
Once the balloon had been brought down, US Navy divers made the surprising discovery that the aircraft had reached heights of over 55,000 feet. Due to the cold war between the US and China, Elda Cantú from the US State Department speculated on the origin of the balloon and was soon joined by Admirals Michael Mullen and Brig Myers and Antonia Blinken of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff.
The news of the balloon quickly spread to the international community. Soon, China, Mexico City, and Venezuela were all sending representatives to Reuters, CNN, and other global news outlets to update the world and provide their respective countries'official stances on the situation.
The mystery of the balloon's origin, however, remains unanswered. While some speculate that the balloon came from Beijing, others are looking toward other nations, including the British and American, who may have had a hand in the balloon's mission.
Although the investigation is ongoing, it remains a point of contention between numerous countries. As February 4th, 2023 passes, people around the world are still wondering - who was the balloon from, and what did the aircraft do on its journey through the skies?

The Colombian National Air Defense System detected an unusual object on Friday morning entering their airspace from the north. The object had the characteristics of a balloon, flying at an altitude of over 55,000 feet and moving quickly at an average rate of 25 knots. Immediately they alerted the national military and launched an investigation to determine its origin. Upon discovering it was a Chinese surveillance tool, the United States government ordered a fighter jet to take it down. It was a high risk situation given the technology used in the balloon and the remote area of the Caribbean.
The news of the downed spy balloon traveled quickly and outrage was felt in Latin America, particularly in Venezuela. President Nicolás Maduro immediately called a press conference, condemning the hostile act by the United States. Maduro argued that the situation should have been handled diplomatically, rather than with aggression. Maduro also took the opportunity to propose the formation of a new international bloc of Latin American and Caribbean countries, in which he referred to Presidents Xi Jinping of China and Vladimir V. Putin of Russia as “older brothers”.
Beijing attempted to defend their actions through the foreign ministry spokeswoman, Mao Ning. She stated that the balloon was on a mission for flight testing but had deviated due to weather conditions and limited self-steering capabilities. She went on to explain that the balloon had been detected in Latin America, Caribbean and US airspace, but posed no threat to any of the countries. China had informed all relevant countries of its presence and they were very understanding. She then condemned the US as having a "clear overreaction," voicing her opinion to CNN and other media outlets.
The Venezuelan Ministry of Foreign Affairs released a statement on Sunday, rejecting the US decision in pursuing the attack against an unarmed Chinese aircraft of civilian origin. They declared the US to be acting with force and not taking the case seriously.
Elda Cantú, a reporter based in Mexico City, added further coverage to the story. The Chinese acknowledged they had “accidentally entered” the airspace of Latin America and the Caribbean, and warned of their limited control abilities over the craft. The Colombian Air Force, as well as Costa Rica’s Civil Aviation Authority, both confirmed a white observation balloon, that was similar to the one spotted in the US, was tracked in their airspace last week, but did not assign it to any country.
The US Navy divers are still working to recover the wreckage of the balloon from the US coastline, where it was shot down over Surfside Beach, South Carolina. US President Joe Biden had first approved of the plan to bring the balloon down on Wednesday, but the US military waited until it passed over water so as not to put citizens in any danger. Admiral Mike Mullen, former United States joint chiefs of staff chairman, asserted the balloon was definitely maneuverable given that it had “propellers”, dismissing China’s suggestion that it may have drifted off course as a result of the weather. In light of the events, Secretary Blinken’s planned trip to China was cancelled.
It is understandable that the US aerial defense system felt the need to take all necessary precautions, especially after the events of the last week. However, steps must be taken diplomatically to ensure similar situations do not happen in the future and to guarantee the security of all the countries involved. This balloon crisis could be the defining moment in the new cold war, so each nation must take proper measures for the security of their airspace, and each other.
