The Colombian National Air Defense System detected an unidentified object in the skies over Latin America and the Caribbean last week and alerted President Nicolás Maduro. The Civil Aviation Authority identified the white observation balloon as similar to one spotted over the United States and tracked it until it left Costa Rican airspace. Mao, a spokesperson for China’s foreign ministry, said at a news conference on Monday that weather conditions and limited control ability over the craft caused the balloon to “seriously deviate” from its planned course and enter Latin America and the Caribbean’s airspace by mistake. The Foreign Affairs Ministry of Venezuela was outraged when the U.S. decided to shoot down a similar balloon, and stated that they “reject the attack … against a civilian unmanned aircraft of Chinese origin.” President Maduro proposed establishing a new international bloc of Latin American and Caribbean countries, referring to Xi Jinping of China and Vladimir V. Putin of Russia as each being an “older brother.” Ms Mao further reported that China had informed all relevant parties and handled the situation responsibly, as the balloon did not pose any threat to any countries. The Colombian Air Force and Costa Rica’s Civil Aviation Authority both confirmed the sighting of the balloon, but did not attribute it to China.
Meanwhile, the US Navy began to search for wreckage remnants of the surveillance balloon that was shot down off the coast of South Carolina on Saturday. This maneuver was approved by US President Joe Biden on Wednesday, and the military jets had to wait until the balloon was over water so as not to put people on the ground at risk. In the following days, Brig. Adm. Mike Mullen of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff briefed the media on the team’s findings. He said that more than 55,000 feet of wreckage had been recovered so far, including parts sent to Beijing for analysis.
The British, American, and Venezuelan governments also expressed their opinion on the matter. The Venezuelan Foreign Affairs Ministry stated that the US “resorts to the use of force, instead of treating this situation with the seriousness and responsibility that the case deserves.” The US ambassador to the United Nations, Antony Blinken, and the State Department declined to comment on the incident. Meanwhile, the international news agency Reuters reported that experts see the incident as a potential indication of a return to Cold War-style espionage tactics.

The Colombian National Air Defense System detected an object on Friday morning, which had characteristics similar to a balloon, entering the country's northern airspace at an altitude of over 55,000 feet and traveling at an average speed of 25 knots. Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro proposed forming a new international bloc in Latin America and the Caribbean, referring to Presidents Xi Jinping of China and Vladimir V. Putin of Russia as “older brothers”. On Saturday, the United States shot down a Chinese spy balloon which had drifted off course in Latin America and the Caribbean due to the weather and limited self-steering capability. The Chinese government then confirmed that the balloon belonged to them. Speaking at a news conference, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mao Ning said that they had informed relevant officials in other nations about the balloon and that “they have expressed their understanding”. However, the Venezuelan Minister of Foreign Affairs rejected the United States’ decision to shoot down the balloon, and stated that “the United States resorts to the use of force, instead of treating this situation with the seriousness and responsibility that the case deserves”. The Colombian Air Force tracked the object until it left the country’s airspace, theorizing that it did not pose a threat to national security. CNN then reached out to get a comment from China, to which Mao Ning responded that the balloon “did not pose any threats to any countries”. Following this, US Navy divers are still trying to recover the wreckage of the surveillance balloon that was shot down off the coast in Surfside Beach, South Carolina.
