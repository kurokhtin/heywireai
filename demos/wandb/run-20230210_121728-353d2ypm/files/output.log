The iconic mountain lion P-22, who made Griffith Park his home for more than 10 years, will be remembered with a memorial hike at the park on Saturday.
The event, organized by Charlie Turner Trailhead and City Councilwoman Nithya Raman's office, will start at 4 p.m. at the trailhead at 2840 in the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. Jordan Traverso, a spokesperson for the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, said the hike will be led by Ashton Hooker of Santa Monica, who will share stories about P-22.
P-22 was first spotted in the park in 2012 and was believed to be about 11 or 12 years old when he died in late February of this year. The beloved big cat was found dead near the 405 Freeway in Hollywood, and an autopsy determined he had been poisoned by rat poison.
Karen Tongson, a spokesperson for the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, said the memorial hike was organized to honor P-22 and his legacy.
"We want to remember P-22, who was a beloved part of the Los Angeles community for so many years," Tongson said.
The event will also feature remarks from Chuck Bonham, director of the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, who said P-22 was an ambassador for mountain lions in the region.
"P-22 was a beloved part of the Los Angeles community for several days, and he was an ambassador for mountain lions everywhere," Bonham said.
The memorial hike will also include a visit to the Los Angeles Zoo, where P-22 was born, and a stop at the San Diego Zoo, where he was first released into the wild in 2012.
At the trailhead, there will be a moment of silence for P-22, and attendees will be encouraged to wear green, the color of the National Park Service, and to bring a flower to place at the memorial.
The event is being organized by the Friends of Griffith Park, and Gerry Hans, the organization's president, said the event will be a fitting tribute to P-22.
"It was FoGP that first brought P-22 to the attention of the public when he was discovered in Griffith Park over a year ago," Hans said.
The event will also feature remarks from Deana Clifford, a veterinarian with the Wallis Annenberg Wildlife Crossing in Agoura Hills, who said P-22 was a symbol of hope for mountain lions in the Ventura area.
"P-22 was a symbol of hope for mountain lions in the Ventura area, and his legacy will live on in the Liberty Canyon Wildlife Crossing, which is scheduled to be completed in 2025," Clifford said.
The memorial hike is being held in honor of P-22, who was beloved by Angelenos for millions of years. California Governor Gavin Newsom declared Saturday as "P-22 Day" in Los Angeles.
The event is being organized by the Mountain Lion Foundation, and P-22's legacy will live on in Los Angeles.

Luna succeeds former Sheriff Jim McDonnell, who retired last week. Luna, who previously served as the Chief of Personnel Command for the Long Beach Police Department, was appointed to the post by the county Board of Supervisors on April Tardy.
Luna has said he plans to focus on improving the department's community relations and rebuilding trust between law enforcement and the community. He has also pledged to focus on recruiting and retaining personnel, including women and minorities.
Luna was joined by his wife, Celines, and other family members at the ceremony, which was held at noon. Also in attendance were Los Angeles Mayor Alex Villanueva, Long Beach Mayor Robert Garcia, and L.A. County Supervisor Holly Mitchell.
"Welcome to a new tan-and-green era," Villanueva said in his address, referring to the colors of the Sheriff's Department.
Luna, who began his career as a deputy in 1992, said he is humbled by the opportunity to lead an agency of more than 18,000 people.
"Today I stand before you, humbled and honored to be the 34th sheriff of Los Angeles County," Luna said.
Luna was appointed to his first command position in 2014, when he became the commander of the Central Patrol Division in Long Beach. He was later promoted to captain, and then assistant chief in 2017.
Luna was appointed interim sheriff in February, after McDonnell retired. He was confirmed to the post by the Board of Supervisors on the Nov. 8, and will serve until 2022.
Michael Avenatti, the lawyer who represented Stormy Daniels in her lawsuit against Donald Trump, was sentenced to 14 years in prison in Orange County today. U.S. District Judge James V. Selna handed down the sentence to Avenatti after hearing arguments from both sides. This comes after Avenatti was convicted of defrauding his clients, including Daniels, of millions of dollars and attempting to extort Nike.
Selna said Avenatti had shown a "pattern of criminal conduct" and that the sentence should reflect the seriousness of the crimes. Avenatti faced a maximum of about 19 years in prison, but Selna said he was taking into account the 51-year-old's prior good works and sentenced him to 14 years.
Avenatti had pleaded guilty in the Central District of California to the Nike extortion charge and in the Southern District of New York to the fraud charges. He was also ordered to pay restitution of $10,810,709.
Avenatti had been facing a possible 17 1/2-year sentence in the California case and only six years in the New York case. At the hearing, Avenatti said he had made mistakes and accepted responsibility for his actions.
The case began in 2017 when Avenatti was accused of embezzling a $1.6 million settlement from a client, Geoffrey Johnson, and using the money to pay his own expenses. Johnson testified at Monday's hearing that he was "devastated" by Avenatti's actions.
Avenatti was also accused of defrauding Tully's Coffee of $12.35 million and of failing to pay taxes on $4 million in income. He was charged in the Central District of California with wire fraud and tax crimes.
In the New York case, Avenatti was accused of attempting to extort Nike. He was charged with wire fraud, extortion, and transmission of interstate communications with intent to extort.
At the sentencing hearing, Avenatti's attorney, Alexis Gardner, said her client was a "David versus Goliath" and that he had taken on powerful interests, including Donald Trump and Nike. She asked the judge to show leniency.
Judge Selna said Avenatti had shown a "pattern of criminal conduct" and that the sentence should reflect the seriousness of the crimes. He sentenced Avenatti to 14 years in prison, to be served in the federal facility in Lompoc.
Avenatti had been facing a possible 17 1/2-year sentence in the California case and only six years in the New York case. Selna said he was taking into account Avenatti's prior good works and sentenced him to 14 years. He was also ordered to pay restitution of $10,810,709.
Avenatti had previously said he was "confident" he would be released in five years, but Selna said that was "a little optimistic." He said Avenatti should be prepared to serve the full 14 years.
Avenatti was arrested last year and has been in custody since then. He was also ordered to pay restitution of $10,810,709.
Avenatti rose to fame in 2017 when he began representing adult film actress Stormy Daniels in her lawsuit against Donald Trump. He also represented other clients in high-profile cases, including five McDonald's workers in St. Louis who accused the company of wage theft.
Avenatti graduated first in his class from George Washington University Law School in 2000. He then moved to California, where he opened his first law office in Newport Beach.
In New York City, Avenatti represented clients in cases against Donald Trump and other powerful interests. He also represented a client in a case against the Department of Justice.
In the Southern District of New York, Avenatti was accused of attempting to extort Nike. He was charged with wire fraud, extortion, and transmission of interstate communications with intent to extort.
In the Central District of California, Avenatti was charged with wire fraud and tax crimes for allegedly defrauding Tully's Coffee of $12.35 million and of failing to pay taxes on $4 million in income.
At the sentencing hearing, Avenatti's attorney, Alexis Gardner, said her client was a "David versus Goliath" and that he had taken on powerful interests, including Donald Trump and Nike. She asked the judge to show leniency.
Judge Selna said he was taking into account the fact that Avenatti had accepted responsibility for his actions and had shown remorse. He also noted that Avenatti had attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and had taken other steps to try to improve himself.
Avenatti was sentenced to 14 years in prison, to be served in the federal facility in Lompoc. He was also ordered to pay restitution of $10,810,709. He will be eligible for release in 2022.
