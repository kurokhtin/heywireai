It was a fateful day in Philadelphia when Ky Carlin, a local athlete and businessman, was out of town and working with the non-profit organization NPBONUSFULL. Ky had to help out with a fundraiser for the Grizzlies in Memphis and wouldn't be back in town for a few days. But decisions were made in Philadelphia during Ky's absence, without knowing the impact they would have on the city today.
The Sixers, Philadelphia's NBA team, had trailed the Memphis Grizzlies by as many as 17 points during the game, but rallies the score to 110-105. It was the fifth win for the Sixers when trailing by 15 or more points in a game's season. Philly had even more to be proud of, considering Joel Embiid had shot only 7-for-25 from the floor.
So, it was Tobias Harris's go-ahead 3-pointer with only 39 seconds remaining that secured the victory, and James Harden's 31 points that gave him a place in the NBA record books, passing Sixers great Allen Iverson for 26th place for all-time scoring.
After the Sixers victory, 76ers coach Doc Rivers was quick to give credit to Embiid, whose six blocks, six assists, 17 defensive rebounds, and one-handed block of Ja Morant were vital during the game. He also praised Harris and Harden, who provided the 3-point and game-winning shot respectively.
The last vestiges of 'The Process' are resting on the legs of Embiid, Harden, and Rivers this season. If the Sixers had not come back on that fateful day, it may have wreaked havoc on the city, considering their 6-game stretch well before the NBA All-Star Game had already been grueling.
The All-Star Game was held in Salt Lake City, Utah, and during this game Luka Dončić of the Mavericks put on quite a show. His shot-for-shot match with the 76ers mascot was caught on TikTok and spread around the Internet. However, it was his 3-point basket that provided the boost that the 76ers needed for the win against their rival - the Memphis Grizzlies.
Ky Carlin, the local athlete and businessman, was still out of town but had heard the good news from friends and family. He said he was proud of the team and thankful for the people who had helped in providing the care and support for the team in his absence. He was sure to meet with the Sixers when he came back and express his gratitude for their hard work.
At the end of the day, it was The Process and these amazing Sixers players that kept Philadelphia safe. Even in times of difficulty, when Ky was away, the team had been able to pull through against all odds and rally in the second half to win the game. Ky said he was proud of the Sixers and the city of Philadelphia and would always remember the incredible victory in Memphis.
