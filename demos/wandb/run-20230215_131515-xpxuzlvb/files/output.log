On Monday, Mao Ning, a spokeswoman for China’s foreign ministry, announced that the white surveillance balloon had "seriously deviated" from its planned course and entered the skies over Latin America and the Caribbean due to weather conditions and limited control ability. The Colombian Air Force and Costa Rica’s Civil Aviation Authority both confirmed that the balloon had been tracked in their airspace last week. Responding to the US decision to shoot down the balloon, the Venezuelan Ministry of Foreign Affairs rejected the attack and expressed disapproval of the US resorting to use of force instead of addressing the situation seriously and responsibly. President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela proposed the formation of a new bloc of Latin American and Caribbean countries, while Russian President Vladimir V. Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping were referred to as “older brothers”.  US President Joe Biden had authorized the plan to bring down the balloon on Wednesday, where it was watched over carefully by the US Joint Chiefs of Staff and the US Navy divers until it had reached a point over water and no longer put anyone on the ground at risk. In a statement on Sunday, the Venezuelan government criticized the US actions and said they had “once again” resorted to the use of force. The work to recover the wreckage of the surveillance balloon from the coast of South Carolina continues.
