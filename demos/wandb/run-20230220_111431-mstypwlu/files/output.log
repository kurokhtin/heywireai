 Karen Bass had lofty ambitions, and despite some long odds, there was always a sense that she was destined for something great. Over the past six years, Bass had worked tirelessly in the Los Angeles office of community safety, helping to spearhead new initiatives that had tangible impacts for the city's most vulnerable. On Monday, July 14th, 2019, those dreams became a reality when Karen Bass was sworn in as the first female mayor of Los Angeles and the 43rd mayor in the city's 241 year history.
The inauguration took place at the Microsoft Theatre, with Vice President Kamala Harris officiating the historic ceremony, attended by California Governor Gavin Newsom, Assembly Speaker Toni Atkins, members of the city council, and prominent civic and business leaders. Surprisingly, the ceremony was also graced by appearances from music icons Stevie Wonder and Chloe Bailey, poets Amanda Gorman and Las Cafeteras.
In her address, Bass declared an emergency on homelessness, pledging to house 17,000 people in her first year in office, and encouraging the people of Los Angeles to come together to find solutions to make neighborhoods safe and housing available in every neighborhood.
Bass' rise to the top had not been easy. She faced off against the billionaire businessman Rick Caruso, who inundated the race with $100 million in funds, but ultimately Bass' poise, experience, and tenacity won the day. Bass had started her path in the medical field, eventually entering the City Council in 2013, rising to Council President in nearly a decade, before Congress then representing the city as a member of the Congressional Black Caucus.
The victory marked a milestone in the US, as four of the five biggest cities in the country now have Black mayors. Council President Paul Krekorian added that Bass was the leader the city of Los Angeles needed to bring people together during this time of turmoil and hope.
Aside from a minor surface win for Cardi B, the fight for city hall had been hard-fought for the past four years, starting with then-councilman Kevin De León’s challenge to incumbent Mayor Eric Garcetti in the 2017 primary, where Garcetti had tried to appear as a centrist.
That was until Robert F. Kennedy’s former counsel Mark Gonzaga championed Councilman Paul Krekorian as the chosen champion of the City Democrats and Los Angeles County Democratic Party. This amounted to a massive shift in politics in Los Angeles as the city council then decided to challenge now-former Mayor Eric Garcetti’s bid for reelection.
The decision to oppose Reelection was considered a no-brainer when an overwhelming majority of the Angelinos, according to a CNS/LA Times poll, determined they would rather elect a change-maker than reelect a mayor who had failed to address the city’s biggest hurdles.
Bass had then surge ahead to lead the city of Los Angeles, becoming the first African-American mayor since Tom Bradley in 1990. Her first act was a message of unity, and as the days leading up to Monday's inauguration progressed, a plan for the city's renewal began to solidify.
Bass inaugurated her term on a strong note and with the help of Vice President Kamala Harris, the event turned into a star-studded gala where the likes of Stevie Wonder, Amanda Gorman, Chloe Bailey and Las Cafeteras performed alongside the beautiful words of Bass.
As the ceremony came to a close, the city of Los Angeles had every reason to look forward to Vice President Harris' words: "What a day this is. One of history, one of progress, one of promise.”
The promise of Bass and her plan of major policy changes and revenue initiatives that tackles within the next four years the problem of getting thousands of Angelenos off the streets, providing thousands more with decent-paying jobs, improving public safety, and delivering educational opportunities that create a bridge of hope and opportunity.
On Nov. 8, 2020, the promise that cities like Los Angeles and its new mayor Karen Bass held, was evident when a huge number of 40,000 people showed up for the festive inauguration held at City Hall on Friday evening.
Since then, the newly-elected mayor has been hard at work on a long list of initiatives. From $100 million in budget cuts and limits to police overtime, to pushing for economic diversification initiatives, and launching her plan of monthly “Keep Our Love Alive” news conferences.
Bass' inauguration was met with much fanfare, with people praising her ability to unite Angelenos together at a time when the world has been fractured by so much chaos and confusion since the days of World War II.
Friends, family, and supporters alike have been looking forward to the coming months and how Bass will move the city forward. Her deadline of October 2021 is quickly approaching, and in an invitation-only event on Sunday, Vice-Mayor Paul Krekorian made a final plea. He said, “We can do this. We need the collective strength of the people of Los Angeles to make an even better tomorrow.”
As the city of Los Angeles enters upon the dawn of another four years, Karen Bass and her supporters look forward to a new era of progress, inclusivity, and stability under the leadership of the city’s first female mayor. And with her first year in office, Bass hopes to have made a difference of housing over 17,000 people, establishing safety and stability, and setting the tone for a future where every Angelino can enjoy a more prosperous and equitable life.

 Karen Bass was sworn in as the 43rd mayor of Los Angeles on Sunday in a historic inauguration at the Microsoft Theater. With Vice President Kamala Harris officiating, this marked a milestone as Bass became the first woman, and the second Black person, to hold the position. The Governor of California, Gavin Newsom, was in attendance, as well as other city officials, and special surprise performances were provided by Stevie Wonder, Chloe Bailey, Las Cafeteras, and Amanda Gorman, the first National Youth Poet Laureate.

Her efforts prior to running had included bringing Black and Latino organizers together to address crime and drug issues by utilizing her expertise in community organizing.

Councilman De Leon expressed agreement, furthering the vision that Los Angeles has on the pioneering path of true inclusion, with City Council now having more women-rated officials than ever before, and the four biggest cities in the country now all having Black mayors.
In her address, Bass spoke of an “inflection point in our history”, acknowledging the pandemic, changing economy, climate, and homelessness crises. As her first act, Bass declared a state of emergency on homelessness id Monday, but she doesn't plan to stop there. Bass plans to launch an Office of Community Safety to make neighborhoods safe, and house people in her first year through her proposed plan to house 17,000 homeless people. She also expressed a desire to make housing available in every neighborhood and called on the people of Los Angeles to focus on solutions over pointing fingers.
The 241-year old City of Los Angeles welcomed their new mayor with open arms, with Angelenos feeling a sense of pride and hope on the future of Los Angeles. The city is in need of great transition and Bass' leadership will more than likely guide it in thee right direction. Her inauguration marks the city's histooric shift in 2020, with Bass serving as mayor for the next four years come October 2021.
Bass' father fled the Jim Crow South in the 1940s, with Bass noting in her speech to hold onto hope and gratitude for her parents. She concluded her address by reminding the public of the 'L.A. Magic' that is still alive and well, ending on a more positive and uplifting note. Bass' victory and installation as Los Angeles mayor is one of the greatest signs of progress in recent years and is a pioneering moment for women and the Black community as a whole.
