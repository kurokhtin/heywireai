 LOS ANGELES (CNS) - Karen Bass was sworn in as the 43rd mayor of Los
Angeles today in a historic inauguration at the Microsoft Theater, becoming the
first woman and second Black person to lead the city.
 Bass was sworn in by Vice President Kamala Harris, a former California
senator and the first woman to serve as the nation's second-in-command.
 Nearly every major city official, along with Gov. Gavin Newsom,
attended the ceremony.
 ``Making history with each of you today is a monumental moment in my
life and for Los Angeles,'' Bass said in her speech.
 Bass addressed what she described as an ``inflection point in our
history,'' with issues including ``the pandemic, the rapidly changing economy,
the rapidly changing climate, the cost of living, (and) 40,000 people sleeping
on the street.''
 ``I believe that times of inflection require reflection -- I believe,
it's time for Angelenos to remind ourselves where we come from and who we
are,'' she said.
 Bass scheduled a news conference at 9 a.m. Monday to declare a state
of emergency on homelessness as her first act as mayor. Her reference to that
action drew a standing ovation. The emergency declaration will ``recognize the
severity of our crisis and break new ground to maximize our ability to urgently
move people inside, and do so for good.
 ``It will create the structure necessary for us to have a true,
unified and citywide strategy to set us on the path to solve homelessness,''
Bass said.
 Bass' plan also includes housing 17,000 homeless people in her first
year. She said Los Angeles has earned the ``shameful crown'' of having some of
the most overcrowded neighborhoods in the country and called for residents to
``welcome housing to every neighborhood.''
 ``We know our mission: We must build housing in every neighborhood,''
Bass said. ``We cannot continue to overcrowd neighborhoods that are already
overcrowded.''
 On crime, Bass sought a strategy to make neighborhoods safe ``that is
informed by our communities,'' which includes launching an Office of Community
Safety.
 ``Of course, we must stop crimes in progress and hold people
accountable,'' Bass said. ``Some neighborhoods have asked for additional
officers, and we will deliver. But what neighborhoods are asking for and what
they need is as diverse as our city.''
 Sunday's ceremony was initially scheduled to take place outside City
Hall, but rain in the forecast led to a venue shift indoors. Instead, Bass was
sworn in on the theater's stage, with two large ``LA'' letters in the mold of
the LAX sign to her right and a picture of the Spring Street City Hall steps
behind the stage.
 ``In our city's 241-year history, we've never witnessed a day like
today as Los Angeles came together to celebrate the swearing in of Mayor Karen
Bass,'' said Mark Gonzalez, chair of the Los Angeles County Democratic Party,
in a statement.
 Surprise performers at the inauguration included Stevie Wonder, who
sang ``Keep Our Love Alive'' and ``Living for the City,'' and Chloe Bailey and
Las Cafeteras. Amanda Gorman, the first National Youth Poet Laureate, who also
delivered a poem at President Joe Biden's inauguration, said in her reading
Sunday that ``the time of never before is officially past.''
 ``For where there's will, there's women,'' Gorman said. ``And where
there's women, there's forever a way.''
 Sunday's event marked the first mayoral inauguration in Los Angeles in
nearly a decade, with outgoing mayor Eric Garcetti holding the post since 2013.
 Bass defeated developer Rick Caruso on Nov. 8 in an expensive and at-
times contentious race.
 She will inherit leadership of a city grappling with a scandal that
has embroiled City Hall for the past two months, after three council members
and a top county labor official took part in a recorded conversation in October
2021 that included racist comments and attempts to manipulate redistricting.
 The fallout has continued to roil City Hall, with Councilman Kevin de
León -- one of the participants in the conversation -- unexpectedly returning
to the chamber on Friday, setting off chaos as he continues to defy calls to
resign. De León later fought with an activist at a holiday tree lighting event
on Friday evening.
 City Council President Paul Krekorian, who swore in five new city
council members and a new city attorney and city controller at Sunday's
ceremony, said that there is no leader more capable of bringing the city
together than Bass.
 ``This is a time of unprecedented challenges in our city, but today as
I look out at this audience and see the people with us, I know that this is
also a time of unprecedented opportunity,'' Krekorian said.
 Krekorian added that Bass will have a ``very strong part in the Los
Angeles City Council,'' a positive sign for Bass -- who will need to have the
council renew her state of emergency for homelessness every month.
 Bass, 69, grew up in the midst of the civil rights movement with three
brothers in the Venice and Fairfax neighborhoods. She was drawn to
community activism after watching the movement on television, volunteering for
Robert F. Kennedy's 1968 presidential campaign when she was 14. Bass said while
her parents did not live to see her take elected office, ``their love, support
and guidance is why I stand before you today.''
 Bass' father fled the Jim Crow south during the great African American
migration after World War II and found work as a letter carrier. His
paycheck supported Bass and her siblings, and allowed her mother to choose to
be a homemaker.
 ``When I think about the dreams of working people today, I reflect on
the fact that my mother and father were able to buy a home in Los Angeles for
their family of six with one paycheck,'' Bass said.
 Bass' organizing career began in 1990 when she founded Community
Coalition, a South Los Angeles social justice group in response to the crack
cocaine crisis. In 2004, Bass was the only Black woman in the state Legislature
when she was elected to the Assembly. Four years later, she became the first
Black woman to lead the chamber. Bass was elected to the U.S. House of
Representatives in 2010 and chaired the Congressional Black Caucus in 2019 and
2020.
 State Senate President pro-Tempore Toni Atkins said that Bass didn't
run for mayor for ``credit or photo-opps.''
 ``She is here to work,'' Atkins said. ``She is here because she loves
this city, she loves its people. She is here to answer the call to serve. And
that is who she is.''
 The new mayor called for the city to focus on solutions rather than
jurisdiction, to link arms rather than point fingers.
 ``If we just focus on bringing people inside, comprehensively
addressing their needs, and moving them to permanent housing with a way to pay
their bills, we will save lives and save our city,'' Bass said. ``That is my
mission as your mayor.''
 Bass said her father taught her to be a critical thinker, and to
understand the historical context of national and international events.
 ``My daily conversations with him led me to make a lifetime commitment
to do whatever I can to change the world,'' she said.
 Through the ``unaffordability, the difficulty, the struggle working
people face today in Los Angeles,'' Bass said that Angelenos have ``never, ever
given up.''
 ``And our magic, L.A. magic, it's still here,'' she said.

On Saturday, a Chinese balloon was shot down by an American fighter jet off the coast of South Carolina after floating in the area for several days. According to Mao Ning, a spokeswoman for China’s foreign ministry, the balloon had been affected by the weather and had limited self-steering capability, causing it to deviate from its planned course and enter Latin America and the Caribbean airspace.
On Friday morning, the Colombian National Air Defense System detected an object with similar characteristics to a balloon flying at an altitude of over 55,000 feet and moving at an average speed of 25 knots. The Colombian Air Force tracked the object until it left the country’s airspace, and determined it did not pose a threat to national security.
Venezuela’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned the US decision to shoot down the balloon, saying “the United States resorts to the use of force, instead of treating this situation with the seriousness and responsibility that the case deserves.” President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela has proposed establishing a new international bloc of Latin American and Caribbean countries, referring to Presidents Xi Jinping of China and Vladimir V. Putin of Russia as each being an “older brother.”
On Monday, China admitted that the balloon belonged to them and had “accidentally entered Latin American and Caribbean airspace” due to weather conditions and limited control ability over the craft. Ms. Mao said that China had informed relevant officials in other nations about the balloon flying over Latin America and that “they have expressed their understanding.” The United States, Ms. Mao said, had “a clear overreaction.”
US Navy divers continue to recover the wreckage of the surveillance balloon that was shot down off the coast in Surfside Beach, South Carolina on Saturday. The planned trip by Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China was cancelled as a result of the row.

On Friday morning, before the United States shot down a Chinese spy balloon that had spent the last week traversing the country, the Colombian National Air Defense System detected an object that had entered the northern part of the country’s airspace, the Colombian Air Force said in a statement. Officials determined that the object had “characteristics similar to those of a balloon,” and that it was flying at an altitude of over 55,000 feet and moving at an average speed of 25 knots. fleet of balloons developed to conduct surveillance operations, which have also violated the sovereignty of other countries,” Brig. The Colombian Air Force said it had tracked the object until it left the country’s airspace, adding that officials determined it did not pose a threat to national security and were investigating its origin. On Sunday, the Venezuelan Ministry of Foreign Affairs, referring to the U.S. decision to shoot down the balloon, said the government “rejects the attack by the United States against a civilian unmanned aircraft of Chinese origin.” In a statement, the Venezuelan government said, “Once again, the United States resorts to the use of force, instead of treating this situation with the seriousness and responsibility that the case deserves.” President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela has recently proposed establishing a new international bloc of Latin American and Caribbean countries and referred to Presidents Xi Jinping of China and Vladimir V.

Ms. Mao said that the Chinese government had informed relevant officials in other nations about the balloon flying over Latin America and that “they have expressed their understanding.” The United States, Ms. Mao said, had “a clear overreaction.” Elda Cantú contributed reporting from Mexico City.Balloon over Latin America belongs to China, Beijing says A balloon spotted over the skies of Latin America belongs to China and was used for flight tests, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said Monday in response to CNN’s queries. This is the first time Beijing has admitted the balloon spotted over two Latin American countries belongs to China. The balloon “seriously deviated” from its planned course and entered the skies over Latin America and the Caribbean “by mistake” due to weather conditions and limited control ability over the craft, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said in a regular press briefing on Monday.

REUTERS/Randall Hill Why the Chinese balloon crisis could be a defining moment in the new Cold War This is the second Chinese balloon Beijing claims has drifted off course due to the weather after the US military on Saturday shot down a suspected Chinese spy balloon that flew over the continental US for days. “China is a responsible country. We have always strictly abided by international law. We have informed all relevant parties and appropriately handled the situation, which did not pose any threats to any countries,” Mao said, adding that all parties “expressed their understanding.” The Colombian Air Force and Costa Rica’s Civil Aviation Authority both confirmed that a white observation balloon similar to the one spotted over the US was tracked in their airspace last week, though they did not attribute the vessel to China.A similar balloon was shot down in US airspace by military jets on Saturday amid allegations that it was being used for surveillance. On Monday, China admitted an aircraft had "accidentally entered Latin American and Caribbean airspace". Ms Mao told reporters the second balloon had "deviated greatly" from its intended route, citing the aircraft's "limited manoeuvrability" and the weather conditions. At the weekend, Colombia's air force said an object with "characteristics similar to those of a balloon" had been detected on 3 February in the country's airspace at above 55,000ft. Meanwhile, work by US Navy divers continues to recover the wreckage of the surveillance balloon that was shot down off the coast of South Carolina on Saturday. US President Joe Biden first approved the plan to bring down the balloon on Wednesday, but decided to wait until it was over water so as not to put people on the ground at risk. Adm Mike Mullen, former chair of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, rejected China's suggestion it might have blown off course, saying it was manoeuvrable because "it has propellers on it". A planned trip by Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China was cancelled as a result of the row.
