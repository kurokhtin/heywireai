As Bass was sworn in to office on Sunday at the Microsoft Theater, Vice President Kamala Harris officiated an historic inauguration, attended by California Governor Gavin Newsom and other prominent politicians.\n\nBass had laid out her plan for tackling the homelessness and crime crisis that plagued the city, an emergency declaration she made in her address to the people of Los Angeles. She pledged to house 17,000 people in her first year and made solutions to make neighborhoods safer and make housing available in every city corner.\n\nThe ceremony had also gotten some star-studded attention and recognition. Guests were in for a surprise when performers like Stevie Wonder, Amanda Gorman, Chloe Bailey, and Las Cafeteras began to celebrate by singing and performing their music.\n\nBass's career began in the medical field but her activism in the community showed her the need for change and she jumped into it quickly. She was appointed a seat in the Assembly and from there she got her Senate seat on Friday, November 8th. Bass overcame fellow wealthier candidate Rick Caruso, who spent more than $100 million on his campaign to become mayor. Delegates from the Los Angeles County Democratic Party, City Council Members, and even Mayor Eric Garcetti, who had been in office since 2013, were full of praise for Bass's campaign.\n\nThe excitement continued when Councilman Kevin de Le\u00f3n announced his news conference with Bass, who was the leader the city of Los Angeles needed to bring people together during this turbulent period of hope. Their proposal focused on an Office of Community Safety and strengthening the City Council's Voice and Role as part of a Community Coalition.\n\nIn 1990, de Le\u00f3n moved to Venice and since then, he had been a vocal proponent of the cause. He was joined by Los Angeles City Hall representatives, Councilman Paul Krekorian and Toni Atkins, who dedicated nearly a decade of service to the city in her 14 years in office, from 2004 to 2010, and the legislature before that.\n\nWith Bass's milestone inauguration, four of the five largest cities in the US can boast African-American mayors. Mark Gonzales, chair of the Congressional Black Caucus said, \"Karen Bass's inauguration is a reflection of the ever-growing influence of African-Americans in politics, a beacon of a more representative government, and an indicator of the work we still have to do to assure justice and equity for all.\"\n\nBass remembered to thank the people of Los Angeles for their support and urged them to keep their love alive and the cause of justice going. She also remembered the importance of her election in light of the civil unrest of the late 1960s, speaking of the \"Shining City on the Hill\" movements of Robert F. Kennedy's hold news conferences in 1968.\n\nPaul Krekorian echoed Gonzalez's reflections of history and Bass's accomplishments. He noted that for the first time in Los Angeles history, a woman of color was inaugurated as mayor, in the same city hall where Bass has served as a member of the city council and was now taking office half a century after World War II.\n\nThough the inauguration ceremony was held on Sunday evening, at 8:50 PM, there will be another ceremony held at City Hall on Monday morning, at 9 AM. During the ceremony, Bass will announce her \"Every Neighborhoods First\" initiative, a plan she's been working on since four years ago, that has the participating of Angelenos and the support of 40,000 people.\n\nThe anticipation is high to see how Karen Bass will make history once again in the beautiful city of Los Angeles in October 2021, when she completes her first year in office.  With Rick Caruso's mega-campaign plans now pushed aside, Los Angeles can finally look forward to having its first female mayor in the city's 241-year-old history."], [["https://socalnews.com/la-story-3.html", "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/05/politics/karen-bass-kamala-harris-inauguration/index.html", "https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/karen-bass-sworn-in-as-43rd-mayor-of-los-angeles-inauguration/"], "Generate a story that involves the following entities and origin example.

This made Bass the first female and second African American to be mayor of Los Angeles, a pivotal milestone in the city\u2019s 241-year history and the first of the four most populous cities in the US, to have a black mayor. Her inauguration, officiated by Vice President Kamala Harris\u2014the first woman to be the US' second-in-charge\u2014was attended by city and state officials, including the Governor of California, Gavin Newsom. In her inauguration address, Bass spoke of an \u201cinflection point in our history,\" fostering hope and promising solutions to civic issues like homelessness, which has become a full-blown crisis post-World War II.\n\nKaren Bass' incredibly inspiring journey began four years prior in 2013 when she first ran to become the LA City Councilman of the LA's Seventh Council District. Though she lost the race, Bass\u2019s \u2018go getter\u2019 attitude and commitment to issues such as drug abuse, workforce development, and gang violence, demanded her re-election to City Council in 2017, this time successfully. As Bass worked closely with community members, she was able to start Community Coalition, which works with grassroots organizations in South LA. During her nearly decade long service in the assembly and Congress, Bass appointed Toni Atkins to be the first ever black woman Senate President Pro Tem. Additionally, she introduced a resolution and advocated against police brutality while urging community safety, understanding between law and order, and grassroots family support.\n\nThe campaign that led Bass\u2019 to the mayoralty started during October 2021, and was a fight between two giants, one being the billionaire developer, Rick Caruso, who spent over $100 million, and Bass, a social worker and devoted community organizer. Throughout her campaign, Bass made sure to bring together a potent force of Black and Latinx organizers, who aim to utilize the power of organized individuals to address crime, drug, and re-development issues in their community. Her methods were so powerful that just two months later, on the 8th of December 2021, Bass was voted in with over 40 thousand votes, thus becoming the first ever female, mayor of Los Angeles. \n\nAs her first act as mayor, Bass declared a state of emergency on homelessness and detailed her plan to house 17,000 homeless people in her first year in office. She also proposed to launch an Office of Community Safety, to ensure communities in and around Los Angeles stay safe. To make housing available to every neighborhood, Bass suggested changes in existing infrastructure and development boards, with an aim to provide help to the less privileged. On her inaugural address, she emphasized unity, rather than division, making an impassioned plea for people to link arms and work towards avenues of harmony.\n\nThe Bass Inauguration ceremony was attended by prominent politicians, including Senate President pro-tem Toni Atkins and LA County Democratic Party Chairman Mark Gonzalez, and concluded with stirring music from iconic performers like Stevie Wonder, Chloe Bailey and Las Cafeteras. Young National Youth Poet Laureate Amanda Gorman captured everyone's attention with her emotional recital of \"Holding the Love\". It was clear that Bass drew upon a powerful legacy of Black leadership and respected the work of the more than 30 mayors who came before her.\n\nBeing the 43rd mayor of Los Angeles, Bass would now be tasked with a challenge of combining her duties with her dedication to community service. Vice President Kamala Harris, who officiated the ceremony, expressed her support with Bass and spoke of her being an absolute fighter who has worked hard to protect the rights of the marginalized. Councilman Kevin de Le\u00f3n, who preceded Bass in City Hall and assured her of his unending support, said Karen Bass is exactly what Los Angeles needs to bring people together.\n\nLooking ahead, Bass has outlined her plan to bring more resources to the south side of Los Angeles and a housing-centric approach for densely populated areas. Moreover, she conveyed that a better future can be achieved using a city-wide magic and by putting the needs of all Angelenos first. Bass concluded her speech by declaring that Friday will be the day she delivers her first state of the city address and will hold a news conference every month in different parts of the city to discuss progress. \n\nThe Inauguration of Karen Bass has been an undeniable turning point in US history and Bass\u2019 ascension to the mayoralty speaks volumes of her dedication to her community and ensures hope to the people of Los Angeles. She has laid the foundation for an even better Los Angeles in the coming years, proving that hard work is never wasted."]]}
