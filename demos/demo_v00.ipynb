      "   Eds: UPDATES with Bass to hold news conference, in 7th graf. Bass'\r\n",

      "   By ERIC HE\r\n",
      "   City News Service\r\n",
      "   LOS ANGELES (CNS) - Karen Bass was sworn in as the 43rd mayor of Los\r\n",
      "Angeles today in a historic inauguration at the Microsoft Theater, becoming the\r\n",
      "first woman and second Black person to lead the city.\r\n",
      "   Bass was sworn in by Vice President Kamala Harris, a former California\r\n",
      "senator and the first woman to serve as the nation's second-in-command.\r\n",
      "   Nearly every major city official, along with Gov. Gavin Newsom,\r\n",
      "attended the ceremony.\r\n",
      "   ``Making history with each of you today is a monumental moment in my\r\n",
      "life and for Los Angeles,'' Bass said in her speech.\r\n",
      "   Bass addressed what she described as an ``inflection point in our\r\n",
      "history,'' with issues including ``the pandemic, the rapidly changing economy,\r\n",
      "the rapidly changing climate, the cost of living, (and) 40,000 people sleeping\r\n",
      "on the street.''\r\n",
      "   ``I believe that times of inflection require reflection -- I believe,\r\n",
      "it's time for Angelenos to remind ourselves where we come from and who we\r\n",
      "are,'' she said.\r\n",
      "   Bass scheduled a news conference at 9 a.m. Monday to declare a state\r\n",
      "of emergency on homelessness as her first act as mayor. Her reference to that\r\n",
      "action drew a standing ovation. The emergency declaration will ``recognize the\r\n",
      "severity of our crisis and break new ground to maximize our ability to urgently\r\n",
      "move people inside, and do so for good.\r\n",
      "   ``It will create the structure necessary for us to have a true,\r\n",
      "unified and citywide strategy to set us on the path to solve homelessness,''\r\n",
      "Bass said.\r\n",
      "   Bass' plan also includes housing 17,000 homeless people in her first\r\n",
      "year. She said Los Angeles has earned the ``shameful crown'' of having some of\r\n",
      "the most overcrowded neighborhoods in the country and called for residents to\r\n",
      "``welcome housing to every neighborhood.''\r\n",
      "   ``We know our mission: We must build housing in every neighborhood,''\r\n",
      "Bass said. ``We cannot continue to overcrowd neighborhoods that are already\r\n",
      "overcrowded.''\r\n",
      "   On crime, Bass sought a strategy to make neighborhoods safe ``that is\r\n",
      "informed by our communities,'' which includes launching an Office of Community\r\n",
      "Safety.\r\n",
      "   ``Of course, we must stop crimes in progress and hold people\r\n",
      "accountable,'' Bass said. ``Some neighborhoods have asked for additional\r\n",
      "officers, and we will deliver. But what neighborhoods are asking for and what\r\n",
      "they need is as diverse as our city.''\r\n",
      "   Sunday's ceremony was initially scheduled to take place outside City\r\n",
      "Hall, but rain in the forecast led to a venue shift indoors. Instead, Bass was\r\n",
      "sworn in on the theater's stage, with two large ``LA'' letters in the mold of\r\n",
      "the LAX sign to her right and a picture of the Spring Street City Hall steps\r\n",
      "behind the stage.\r\n",
      "   ``In our city's 241-year history, we've never witnessed a day like\r\n",
      "today as Los Angeles came together to celebrate the swearing in of Mayor Karen\r\n",
      "Bass,'' said Mark Gonzalez, chair of the Los Angeles County Democratic Party,\r\n",
      "in a statement.\r\n",
      "   Surprise performers at the inauguration included Stevie Wonder, who\r\n",
      "sang ``Keep Our Love Alive'' and ``Living for the City,'' and Chloe Bailey and\r\n",
      "Las Cafeteras. Amanda Gorman, the first National Youth Poet Laureate, who also\r\n",
      "delivered a poem at President Joe Biden's inauguration, said in her reading\r\n",
      "Sunday that ``the time of never before is officially past.''\r\n",
      "   ``For where there's will, there's women,'' Gorman said. ``And where\r\n",
      "there's women, there's forever a way.''\r\n",
      "   Sunday's event marked the first mayoral inauguration in Los Angeles in\r\n",
      "nearly a decade, with outgoing mayor Eric Garcetti holding the post since 2013.\r\n",
      "   Bass defeated developer Rick Caruso on Nov. 8 in an expensive and at-\r\n",
      "times contentious race.\r\n",
      "   She will inherit leadership of a city grappling with a scandal that\r\n",
      "has embroiled City Hall for the past two months, after three council members\r\n",
      "and a top county labor official took part in a recorded conversation in October\r\n",
      "2021 that included racist comments and attempts to manipulate redistricting.\r\n",
      "   The fallout has continued to roil City Hall, with Councilman Kevin de\r\n",
      "León -- one of the participants in the conversation -- unexpectedly returning\r\n",
      "to the chamber on Friday, setting off chaos as he continues to defy calls to\r\n",
      "resign. De León later fought with an activist at a holiday tree lighting event\r\n",
      "on Friday evening.\r\n",
      "   City Council President Paul Krekorian, who swore in five new city\r\n",
      "council members and a new city attorney and city controller at Sunday's\r\n",
      "ceremony, said that there is no leader more capable of bringing the city\r\n",
      "together than Bass.\r\n",
      "   ``This is a time of unprecedented challenges in our city, but today as\r\n",
      "I look out at this audience and see the people with us, I know that this is\r\n",
      "also a time of unprecedented opportunity,'' Krekorian said.\r\n",
      "   Krekorian added that Bass will have a ``very strong part in the Los\r\n",
      "Angeles City Council,'' a positive sign for Bass -- who will need to have the\r\n",
      "council renew her state of emergency for homelessness every month.\r\n",
      "   Bass, 69, grew up in the midst of the civil rights movement with three\r\n",
      "brothers in the Venice and Fairfax neighborhoods. She was drawn to\r\n",
      "community activism after watching the movement on television, volunteering for\r\n",
      "Robert F. Kennedy's 1968 presidential campaign when she was 14. Bass said while\r\n",
      "her parents did not live to see her take elected office, ``their love, support\r\n",
      "and guidance is why I stand before you today.''\r\n",
      "   Bass' father fled the Jim Crow south during the great African American\r\n",
      "migration after World War II and found work as a letter carrier. His\r\n",
      "paycheck supported Bass and her siblings, and allowed her mother to choose to\r\n",
      "be a homemaker.\r\n",
      "   ``When I think about the dreams of working people today, I reflect on\r\n",
      "the fact that my mother and father were able to buy a home in Los Angeles for\r\n",
      "their family of six with one paycheck,'' Bass said.\r\n",
      "   Bass' organizing career began in 1990 when she founded Community\r\n",
      "Coalition, a South Los Angeles social justice group in response to the crack\r\n",
      "cocaine crisis. In 2004, Bass was the only Black woman in the state Legislature\r\n",
      "when she was elected to the Assembly. Four years later, she became the first\r\n",
      "Black woman to lead the chamber. Bass was elected to the U.S. House of\r\n",
      "Representatives in 2010 and chaired the Congressional Black Caucus in 2019 and\r\n",
      "2020.\r\n",
      "   State Senate President pro-Tempore Toni Atkins said that Bass didn't\r\n",
      "run for mayor for ``credit or photo-opps.''\r\n",
      "   ``She is here to work,'' Atkins said. ``She is here because she loves\r\n",
      "this city, she loves its people. She is here to answer the call to serve. And\r\n",
      "that is who she is.''\r\n",
      "   The new mayor called for the city to focus on solutions rather than\r\n",
      "jurisdiction, to link arms rather than point fingers.\r\n",
      "   ``If we just focus on bringing people inside, comprehensively\r\n",
      "addressing their needs, and moving them to permanent housing with a way to pay\r\n",
      "their bills, we will save lives and save our city,'' Bass said. ``That is my\r\n",
      "mission as your mayor.''\r\n",
      "   Bass said her father taught her to be a critical thinker, and to\r\n",
      "understand the historical context of national and international events.\r\n",
      "   ``My daily conversations with him led me to make a lifetime commitment\r\n",
      "to do whatever I can to change the world,'' she said.\r\n",
      "   Through the ``unaffordability, the difficulty, the struggle working\r\n",
      "people face today in Los Angeles,'' Bass said that Angelenos have ``never, ever\r\n",
      "given up.''\r\n",
      "   ``And our magic, L.A. magic, it's still here,'' she said.\r\n",

The sentence is the result of Avenatti's conviction on charges related to his extortion of Nike and defrauding of his former client Stormy Daniels and other clients. The sentence is longer than the five years requested by prosecutors and the 12 months requested by Avenatti's lawyers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Avenatti, a 51-year-old Newport Beach attorney, was convicted in February of all three counts he faced: honest services wire fraud, extortion and transmission of interstate communications with intent to extort. He was found guilty of attempting to extort Nike for at least $85 million and defrauding Daniels of about $300,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the sentencing hearing in Santa Ana, Selna said Avenatti had committed \"a very serious offense\" and that \"a substantial term of imprisonment is required.\" He imposed a sentence of 14 years in prison, followed by five years of supervised release.\n",
      "\n",
      "Avenatti had already been sentenced in the Nike case in New York to three years in prison and in the Daniels case in California to 17 1/2 years, but Selna said he would run the sentences concurrently. This means Avenatti will only serve 14 years, rather than the combined total of about 19 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to the prison sentence, Selna ordered Avenatti to pay restitution of $10,810,709 to victims in four separate cases, including the IRS. Avenatti was also ordered to pay a $250,000 fine and to forfeit $2.75 million.\n",

      "Avenatti had been in custody since last year, when he was arrested in Palm Springs, California, on charges of violating the terms of his release in the New York case. U.S. District Judge Brett Sagel had ordered him to stay in the Southern District of New York, but Avenatti had gone to California.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the sentencing hearing, Avenatti's lawyer, Alexis Gardner, compared Avenatti to David, the biblical figure who fought Goliath. She said Avenatti had taken on \"some of the most powerful Goliaths in the world,\" including Donald Trump and Nike.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gardner said Avenatti had been punished enough by the time he'd already served in jail and by the \"public humiliation\" he had suffered. She asked Selna to sentence Avenatti to only six years in prison.\n",
      "\n",
      "Avenatti had faced a maximum sentence of 335 years in prison for the three convictions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Selna said on Monday that he believed Avenatti had a \"history of deception\" and had \"abused the trust of those around him.\" He noted that Avenatti had failed to pay $8 million in taxes and had failed to pay $12.35 million in restitution to a former client.\n",
      "\n",
      "The judge also noted that Avenatti had lied to the IRS about the amount of money he had made from Tully's Coffee and had lied to the court about his finances. He said Avenatti had \"failed to pay taxes for about four years\" and had \"failed to pay about $3.2 million in taxes and about $1.6 million in trust taxes\" to the IRS.\n",
      "\n",
      "Avenatti's lawyer, Dean Steward, argued that his client had made mistakes, but had also done a lot of good in his life. He said Avenatti had worked hard, graduating from George Washington University Law School and becoming a successful lawyer in California.\n",

      "Steward said Avenatti had been the first lawyer to take on Donald Trump and that he had done it pro bono. He said Avenatti had also represented workers at McDonald's in St. Louis who were trying to unionize, and that he had taken on the first case of its kind in the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "Steward also said Avenatti had been the first lawyer to represent a group of homeless people in Venice, California, who were being evicted from their camp on Terminal Island. He said Avenatti had also attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and had been sober since March 15.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before being sentenced, Avenatti apologized to the court and to the victims of his crimes. He said he had been \"a fool\" and that he had made mistakes. He said he had been \"deeply ashamed\" of his actions.\n",

      "Avenatti had been facing charges in four separate cases in New York, California, the Central District of California and the Southern District of New York. In the New York case, U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman's office accused him of attempting to extort Nike. In the California case, U.S. Attorney Nichola Hanna's office accused him of defrauding Daniels.\n",

       "\"Bass Inauguration, 3rd LdDate: 12-11-2022 8:50 PM - Word Count: 1283Bass Inauguration, 3rd Ld\\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0 Karen Bass Inaugurated as Mayor, to Hold News Conference\\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0 Eds: UPDATES with Bass to hold news conference, in 7th graf. Bass'\\r\\noffice can be reached at press@karenbass.com.\\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0 By ERIC HE\\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0 City News Service\\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0 LOS ANGELES (CNS) - Karen Bass was sworn in as the 43rd mayor of Los\\r\\nAngeles today in a historic inauguration at the Microsoft Theater, becoming the\\r\\nfirst woman and second Black person to lead the city.\\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0 Bass was sworn in by Vice President Kamala Harris, a former California\\r\\nsenator and the first woman to serve as the nation's second-in-command.\\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0 Nearly every major city official, along with Gov. Gavin Newsom,\\r\\nattended the ceremony.\\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0 ``Making history with each of you today is a monumental moment in my\\r\\nlife and for Los Angeles,'' Bass said in her speech.\\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0 Bass addressed what she described as an ``inflection point in our\\r\\nhistory,'' with issues including ``the pandemic, the rapidly changing economy,\\r\\nthe rapidly changing climate, the cost of living, (and) 40,000 people sleeping\\r\\non the street.''\\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0 ``I believe that times of inflection require reflection -- I believe,\\r\\nit's time for Angelenos to remind ourselves where we come from and who we\\r\\nare,'' she said.\\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0 Bass scheduled a news conference at 9 a.m. Monday to declare a state\\r\\nof emergency on homelessness as her first act as mayor. Her reference to that\\r\\naction drew a standing ovation. The emergency declaration will ``recognize the\\r\\nseverity of our crisis and break new ground to maximize our ability to urgently\\r\\nmove people inside, and do so for good.\\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0 ``It will create the structure necessary for us to have a true,\\r\\nunified and citywide strategy to set us on the path to solve homelessness,''\\r\\nBass said.\\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0 Bass' plan also includes housing 17,000 homeless people in her first\\r\\nyear. She said Los Angeles has earned the ``shameful crown'' of having some of\\r\\nthe most overcrowded neighborhoods in the country and called for residents to\\r\\n``welcome housing to every neighborhood.''\\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0 ``We know our mission: We must build housing in every neighborhood,''\\r\\nBass said. ``We cannot continue to overcrowd neighborhoods that are already\\r\\novercrowded.''\\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0 On crime, Bass sought a strategy to make neighborhoods safe ``that is\\r\\ninformed by our communities,'' which includes launching an Office of Community\\r\\nSafety.\\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0 ``Of course, we must stop crimes in progress and hold people\\r\\naccountable,'' Bass said. ``Some neighborhoods have asked for additional\\r\\nofficers, and we will deliver. But what neighborhoods are asking for and what\\r\\nthey need is as diverse as our city.''\\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0 Sunday's ceremony was initially scheduled to take place outside City\\r\\nHall, but rain in the forecast led to a venue shift indoors. Instead, Bass was\\r\\nsworn in on the theater's stage, with two large ``LA'' letters in the mold of\\r\\nthe LAX sign to her right and a picture of the Spring Street City Hall steps\\r\\nbehind the stage.\\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0 ``In our city's 241-year history, we've never witnessed a day like\\r\\ntoday as Los Angeles came together to celebrate the swearing in of Mayor Karen\\r\\nBass,'' said Mark Gonzalez, chair of the Los Angeles County Democratic Party,\\r\\nin a statement.\\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0 Surprise performers at the inauguration included Stevie Wonder, who\\r\\nsang ``Keep Our Love Alive'' and ``Living for the City,'' and Chloe Bailey and\\r\\nLas Cafeteras. Amanda Gorman, the first National Youth Poet Laureate, who also\\r\\ndelivered a poem at President Joe Biden's inauguration, said in her reading\\r\\nSunday that ``the time of never before is officially past.''\\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0 ``For where there's will, there's women,'' Gorman said. ``And where\\r\\nthere's women, there's forever a way.''\\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0 Sunday's event marked the first mayoral inauguration in Los Angeles in\\r\\nnearly a decade, with outgoing mayor Eric Garcetti holding the post since 2013.\\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0 Bass defeated developer Rick Caruso on Nov. 8 in an expensive and at-\\r\\ntimes contentious race.\\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0 She will inherit leadership of a city grappling with a scandal that\\r\\nhas embroiled City Hall for the past two months, after three council members\\r\\nand a top county labor official took part in a recorded conversation in October\\r\\n2021 that included racist comments and attempts to manipulate redistricting.\\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0 The fallout has continued to roil City Hall, with Councilman Kevin de\\r\\nLeón -- one of the participants in the conversation -- unexpectedly returning\\r\\nto the chamber on Friday, setting off chaos as he continues to defy calls to\\r\\nresign. De León later fought with an activist at a holiday tree lighting event\\r\\non Friday evening.\\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0 City Council President Paul Krekorian, who swore in five new city\\r\\ncouncil members and a new city attorney and city controller at Sunday's\\r\\nceremony, said that there is no leader more capable of bringing the city\\r\\ntogether than Bass.\\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0 ``This is a time of unprecedented challenges in our city, but today as\\r\\nI look out at this audience and see the people with us, I know that this is\\r\\nalso a time of unprecedented opportunity,'' Krekorian said.\\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0 Krekorian added that Bass will have a ``very strong part in the Los\\r\\nAngeles City Council,'' a positive sign for Bass -- who will need to have the\\r\\ncouncil renew her state of emergency for homelessness every month.\\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0 Bass, 69, grew up in the midst of the civil rights movement with three\\r\\nbrothers in the Venice and Fairfax neighborhoods. She was drawn to\\r\\ncommunity activism after watching the movement on television, volunteering for\\r\\nRobert F. Kennedy's 1968 presidential campaign when she was 14. Bass said while\\r\\nher parents did not live to see her take elected office, ``their love, support\\r\\nand guidance is why I stand before you today.''\\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0 Bass' father fled the Jim Crow south during the great African American\\r\\nmigration after World War II and found work as a letter carrier. His\\r\\npaycheck supported Bass and her siblings, and allowed her mother to choose to\\r\\nbe a homemaker.\\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0 ``When I think about the dreams of working people today, I reflect on\\r\\nthe fact that my mother and father were able to buy a home in Los Angeles for\\r\\ntheir family of six with one paycheck,'' Bass said.\\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0 Bass' organizing career began in 1990 when she founded Community\\r\\nCoalition, a South Los Angeles social justice group in response to the crack\\r\\ncocaine crisis. In 2004, Bass was the only Black woman in the state Legislature\\r\\nwhen she was elected to the Assembly. Four years later, she became the first\\r\\nBlack woman to lead the chamber. Bass was elected to the U.S. House of\\r\\nRepresentatives in 2010 and chaired the Congressional Black Caucus in 2019 and\\r\\n2020.\\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0 State Senate President pro-Tempore Toni Atkins said that Bass didn't\\r\\nrun for mayor for ``credit or photo-opps.''\\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0 ``She is here to work,'' Atkins said. ``She is here because she loves\\r\\nthis city, she loves its people. She is here to answer the call to serve. And\\r\\nthat is who she is.''\\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0 The new mayor called for the city to focus on solutions rather than\\r\\njurisdiction, to link arms rather than point fingers.\\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0 ``If we just focus on bringing people inside, comprehensively\\r\\naddressing their needs, and moving them to permanent housing with a way to pay\\r\\ntheir bills, we will save lives and save our city,'' Bass said. ``That is my\\r\\nmission as your mayor.''\\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0 Bass said her father taught her to be a critical thinker, and to\\r\\nunderstand the historical context of national and international events.\\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0 ``My daily conversations with him led me to make a lifetime commitment\\r\\nto do whatever I can to change the world,'' she said.\\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0 Through the ``unaffordability, the difficulty, the struggle working\\r\\npeople face today in Los Angeles,'' Bass said that Angelenos have ``never, ever\\r\\ngiven up.''\\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0 ``And our magic, L.A. magic, it's still here,'' she said.\\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0 Copyright 2022, City News Service, Inc.\\n\\r\\nCNS-12-11-2022 20:50\""

The Colombian authorities alerted the Civil Aviation Authority in neighboring Costa Rica, who were quick to take on the responsibility of monitoring the air-borne craft and reporting its trajectory when it came within a few miles of their own airspace. \\n\\nFor the better part of the week, the balloon’s journey remained largely unrestricted and unquestioned. That was until last Friday morning, when the US Joint Chiefs of Staff took note and identified the mysterious vessel as a Chinese craft. There had been simmering tensions between China and the United States over both economic and political issues that had reached another boiling point due to the US’s decision to enforce sanctions on Chinese companies in the lead up to the next Cold War. \\n\\nChinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning was quick to respond to the US’s accusations. In a news conference on Monday she explained that the balloon had “seriously deviated” from its planned course, citing the limited control ability over the craft due to unfavorable weather conditions. Furthermore, the spokeswoman added that China had “informed all relevant parties and appropriately handled the situation, which did not pose any threats to any countries.” This was quickly backed up by statements from the Colombian Air Force, the Venezuelan Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Costa Rican Civil Aviation Authority, all of whom had tracked the object and explicitly stated that it posed no danger to national security. \\n\\nThe following day, US President Joe Biden authorized the shooting down of the craft, despite vehement protests from its creator, Chinese President Xi Jinping. In a statement released by the White House, military advisor Admiral Mike Mullen declared the craft to have been on a clear mission to perform surveillance of US airspace and thus posed a direct threat to national security. \\n\\nBut late Sunday night, Venezuela’s President Nicolás Maduro, who had only recently proposed establishing a new international bloc of Latin American and Caribbean countries, strongly condemned the US’s decision to bring down the balloon, claiming that the US government had “once again resorted to the use of force, instead of treating this situation with the seriousness and responsibility that the case deserves.” He further referred to the Presidents Xi Jinping of China and Vladimir V. Putin of Russia as the “older brothers”, implying an even stronger alliance between the three countries than ever before.\\n\\nThe White House, however, remained adamant in its stance that the incident had required military action for the safety and security of the US. “Given the nature of the observation craft,” stated White House Press Secretary Elda Cantú, “and the lack of a response from the Beijing government, the President made the decision to cause it no harm and ensure that it be safely taken out of the air by Navy divers near the coast of Mexico City.” \\n\\nSo, on the morning of February 4th, 2023, US Navy divers showed up to the site of the shooting 3 days earlier, near the town of Surfside Beach in South Carolina, and began their task of recovering the wreckage of the surveillance balloon. What began as the white observation balloon soaring through the skies above the Caribbean and Latin America, had now been brought to an abrupt end.'"

      "\n",
      "But late Sunday night, Venezuela’s President Nicolás Maduro, who had only recently proposed establishing a new international bloc of Latin American and Caribbean countries, strongly condemned the US’s decision to bring down the balloon, claiming that the US government had “once again resorted to the use of force, instead of treating this situation with the seriousness and responsibility that the case deserves.” He further referred to the Presidents Xi Jinping of China and Vladimir V. Putin of Russia as the “older brothers”, implying an even stronger alliance between the three countries than ever before.\n",
      "\n",
      "The White House, however, remained adamant in its stance that the incident had required military action for the safety and security of the US. “Given the nature of the observation craft,” stated White House Press Secretary Elda Cantú, “and the lack of a response from the Beijing government, the President made the decision to cause it no harm and ensure that it be safely taken out of the air by Navy divers near the coast of Mexico City.” \n",
      "\n",
      "So, on the morning of February 4th, 2023, US Navy divers showed up to the site of the shooting 3 days earlier, near the town of Surfside Beach in South Carolina, and began their task of recovering the wreckage of the surveillance balloon. What began as the white observation balloon soaring through the skies above the Caribbean and Latin America, had now been brought to an abrupt end.\n"

    "Bass will make history as the first female mayor of Los Angeles, also making her the first woman of color to hold the job. Harris, just the second-ever Black female US senator, made history when she became the first female, first Black and first South Asian person to serve as vice president.\n",
    "Bass, who will succeed term-limited Mayor Eric Garcetti, will begin her mayoral term on December 12. When she takes office, the four largest cities in the US will all have Black mayors – that includes Eric Adams of New York City, Lori Lightfoot of Chicago and Sylvester Turner of Houston.\n",
    "Bass, who was elected to the California state Assembly in 2004, made history some four years later as the first Black woman to serve as speaker of any state legislature.\n",
    "Bass alluded to her history of firsts shortly after winning her race when she told reporters that the accomplishment of becoming the first female mayor of Los Angeles was still “sinking in.”\n",
    "“When you’re in a position like this – and I was in a similar position when I was sworn in as speaker – it means that you have extra responsibility. You always have to make sure that you maintain excellence in every step of the way,” Bass said. “The path that you go is laying the foundation for those that come behind you.”\n",
    "After her victory, Bass promised to solve the homelessness crisis in the nation’s second-largest city.\n",
    "“She is holding her inaugural ceremony on Sunday to make it easier for Angelenos to attend and to ensure her first day as mayor is dedicated to bringing unhoused Angelenos inside and making our city safer and more livable for all,” the mayor-elect’s office said in a statement announcing the ceremony.\n",

    "During her campaign, Bass leaned into her experience bringing together Black and Latino community organizers in South Los Angeles in the early 1990s to address the root causes of crime and the crack epidemic. She was able to put together a winning coalition of Black voters in South Los Angeles and White progressives on the city’s west side to help overcome Caruso’s spending.\n",

    "Instead of being sworn in on City Hall's steps as tradition would have it, the city adapted to the powerful storm moving through the area, posting the letters \"LA\" in the mold of the LAX sign to her right and a picture of the Spring Street City Hall steps behind the stage.\n",

    "\"I will start my first day as mayor at the city's emergency operations centers, where my first act as mayor will be to declare a state of emergency on homelessness,\" Bass said, noting that she will \"recognize the severity of our crisis and break new ground to maximize our ability to urgently move people inside, and do so for good.\"\n",
    "She plans to house 17,000 people in her first year in office, hoping to \"welcome housing to every neighborhood.\"\n",

    "Bass also touched on another pressing issue facing her in her first day as mayor. \n",
    "\"Of course, we must stop crimes in progress and hold people accountable,\" Bass said. \"Some neighborhoods have asked for additional officers, and we will deliver. But what neighborhoods are asking for and what they need is as diverse as our city.\"\n",

    "\"Making history with each of you today is a monumental moment in my life and for Los Angeles,\" Bass said during her speech.\n",

    "She takes over in a time of turmoil, as the Los Angeles City Council struggles to conduct business through a racially-charged scandal involving several prominent members, but also at a time of hope, as the council will hold more women than ever before after the five newest members swore in over the weekend. \n",
    "Council President Paul Krekorian spoke at the event, predicting that Bass is just the leader the city of Los Angeles needs to bring people together. \n",
    "\"This is a time of unprecedented challenges in our city, but today as I look out at this audience and see the people with us, I know that this is also a time of unprecedented opportunity,\" Krekorian said.\n",
    "Bass will replace fellow Democrat Eric Garcetti, who came to the end of two mayoral terms on Saturday.

Dozens of prominent politicians were in attendance for the inauguration, including California State Senate President pro-tempore Toni Atkins, Los Angeles County Democratic Party Chairman Mark Gonzalez and Governor Gavin Newsom. Bass, 69, was a social worker and community activist before representing Los Angeles in the state Assembly for six years, where she also served as the first African American speaker. He now awaits further plans pending his nomination to become U.S. ambassador to India, which has hit a snag due to opposition from some on Senate, concerned with sexual misconduct allegations against a former Garcetti staff member.\""

On Sunday, January 14, 2022, history would be made as she became the 43rd mayor of Los Angeles.\\n\\nThe ceremony was scheduled to take place at City Hall, but due to bad weather it was shifted indoors to the Microsoft Theater. A confirmed list of guests included Vice President Kamala Harris who swore in Bass as mayor, California State Senate President pro-Tempore Toni Atkins, Los Angeles County Democratic Party Chair Mark Gonzalez, and Governor Gavin Newsom. Bass was not alone in making history, however– Amanda Gorman, first National Youth Poet Laureate, made a surprise appearance and said, “The time of never before is officially past.”\\n\\nAs her story is intertwined with the city of Los Angeles and an epic fight against poverty and addiction, Bass took this time to honor and reflect on her roots and the legacy of civil rights leaders such as Robert F.

The inauguration, which was originally going to be held outside City Hall, was moved indoors due to rain but that didn’t dampen the festive spirit of the day. A large crowd gathered to witness the special occasion, including prominent politicians such as California State Senate President pro-tempore Toni Atkins, Los Angeles County Democratic Party Chairman Mark Gonzalez, Governor Gavin Newsom, and Kamala Harris.\\n\\nMayor-elect Bass began her career in 1990 as a physician assistant in the emergency room at a Los Angeles County hospital. But it was her founding of the South Los Angeles social justice organization, Community Coalition, in response to the crack cocaine crisis that really had an impact. This experience of bringing together Black and Latino community organizers to tackle the root causes of crime and drug addiction in the city established her as a leader in local politics.\\n\\nIn 2002, Bass began her first term in the California State Assembly, where she eventually became the first African American Speaker. Four years later she was elected to the Los Angeles City Council, where she served for six years, before running for mayor. During her campaign she honed in on her experience from nearly a decade prior to bring social justice to South Los Angeles. Her hard work was rewarded when she was elected to office in the historic November 8, 2020 election, beating out her competitors City Councilman Kevin De León, incumbent Mayor Eric Garcetti, and Paul Kerkorain. \\n\\nAt 8:50 pm on Sunday, March 14th, 2021, that hard work paid off. Bass was sworn into office at the Microsoft Theater in what had been planned to be an outdoor ceremony in front of City Hall. Along with her were her fellow Angelenos, speakers like former State Senator Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., and first National Youth Poet Laureate, Amanda Gorman. \\n\\nGorman, who had read her own poem at President Joe Biden’s inauguration in January, was delighted to be part of the celebration. “The time of never before is officially past,” she read with emotion. Bass and Gorman were joined by singer Chloe Bailey who performed a soulful rendition of Stevie Wonder’s Living for the City and Keep Our Love from 1968. This was followed by Eds from LAX who rapped, and over 40,000 people watched the live stream of the event.\\n\\nFriends, family, and political figures alike came to celebrate the inaugural of Bass’ first year in office, and the Los Angeles County Democratic Party Chairman, Mark Gonzalez, presented Bass with a rose, calling it a “token of the admiration we have for you.” Governor Gavin Newsom also attended the swearing in ceremony, and Rick Caruso, the CEO of the real estate firm Caruso Affiliated, presented Bass with the keys to New City, a real estate development currently in development.\\n\\nDue to Mayor Bass’ work earlier in her career to bring together Black and Latino Angelenos to address the root causes of crime and the crack epidemic, Los Angeles City Council President Nury Martinez set in motion the Office of Community Safety and issued a memorandum noting that 17,000 people had been employed as a direct result of the organization’s actions. In addition, Martinez and members of the Congressional Black Caucus, have sought to commemorate the momentous occasion by launching the“Bass Inauguration”, a campaign that involves the donation of more than 1,200 meals every month to support Black and Latino families, something that Bass herself supported during her campaign.\\n\\nOne can’t help but think of Robert F. Kennedy’s famous quote “A small act of kindness can change the world”. It’s this sentiment that has underpinned Sharon Bass’ work and continues to guide her as mayor of Los Angeles. The city of Los Angeles has come a long way since its beginnings back in 2019, and there is still much to be done. The day marked the official beginning of a new chapter for the City of Angels and for Mayor Bass, one that is sure to be filled with continued effort and compassion for her fellow Angelenos.'"
