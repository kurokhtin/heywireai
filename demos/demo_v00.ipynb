      "   Eds: UPDATES with Bass to hold news conference, in 7th graf. Bass'\r\n",

      "   By ERIC HE\r\n",
      "   City News Service\r\n",
      "   LOS ANGELES (CNS) - Karen Bass was sworn in as the 43rd mayor of Los\r\n",
      "Angeles today in a historic inauguration at the Microsoft Theater, becoming the\r\n",
      "first woman and second Black person to lead the city.\r\n",
      "   Bass was sworn in by Vice President Kamala Harris, a former California\r\n",
      "senator and the first woman to serve as the nation's second-in-command.\r\n",
      "   Nearly every major city official, along with Gov. Gavin Newsom,\r\n",
      "attended the ceremony.\r\n",
      "   ``Making history with each of you today is a monumental moment in my\r\n",
      "life and for Los Angeles,'' Bass said in her speech.\r\n",
      "   Bass addressed what she described as an ``inflection point in our\r\n",
      "history,'' with issues including ``the pandemic, the rapidly changing economy,\r\n",
      "the rapidly changing climate, the cost of living, (and) 40,000 people sleeping\r\n",
      "on the street.''\r\n",
      "   ``I believe that times of inflection require reflection -- I believe,\r\n",
      "it's time for Angelenos to remind ourselves where we come from and who we\r\n",
      "are,'' she said.\r\n",
      "   Bass scheduled a news conference at 9 a.m. Monday to declare a state\r\n",
      "of emergency on homelessness as her first act as mayor. Her reference to that\r\n",
      "action drew a standing ovation. The emergency declaration will ``recognize the\r\n",
      "severity of our crisis and break new ground to maximize our ability to urgently\r\n",
      "move people inside, and do so for good.\r\n",
      "   ``It will create the structure necessary for us to have a true,\r\n",
      "unified and citywide strategy to set us on the path to solve homelessness,''\r\n",
      "Bass said.\r\n",
      "   Bass' plan also includes housing 17,000 homeless people in her first\r\n",
      "year. She said Los Angeles has earned the ``shameful crown'' of having some of\r\n",
      "the most overcrowded neighborhoods in the country and called for residents to\r\n",
      "``welcome housing to every neighborhood.''\r\n",
      "   ``We know our mission: We must build housing in every neighborhood,''\r\n",
      "Bass said. ``We cannot continue to overcrowd neighborhoods that are already\r\n",
      "overcrowded.''\r\n",
      "   On crime, Bass sought a strategy to make neighborhoods safe ``that is\r\n",
      "informed by our communities,'' which includes launching an Office of Community\r\n",
      "Safety.\r\n",
      "   ``Of course, we must stop crimes in progress and hold people\r\n",
      "accountable,'' Bass said. ``Some neighborhoods have asked for additional\r\n",
      "officers, and we will deliver. But what neighborhoods are asking for and what\r\n",
      "they need is as diverse as our city.''\r\n",
      "   Sunday's ceremony was initially scheduled to take place outside City\r\n",
      "Hall, but rain in the forecast led to a venue shift indoors. Instead, Bass was\r\n",
      "sworn in on the theater's stage, with two large ``LA'' letters in the mold of\r\n",
      "the LAX sign to her right and a picture of the Spring Street City Hall steps\r\n",
      "behind the stage.\r\n",
      "   ``In our city's 241-year history, we've never witnessed a day like\r\n",
      "today as Los Angeles came together to celebrate the swearing in of Mayor Karen\r\n",
      "Bass,'' said Mark Gonzalez, chair of the Los Angeles County Democratic Party,\r\n",
      "in a statement.\r\n",
      "   Surprise performers at the inauguration included Stevie Wonder, who\r\n",
      "sang ``Keep Our Love Alive'' and ``Living for the City,'' and Chloe Bailey and\r\n",
      "Las Cafeteras. Amanda Gorman, the first National Youth Poet Laureate, who also\r\n",
      "delivered a poem at President Joe Biden's inauguration, said in her reading\r\n",
      "Sunday that ``the time of never before is officially past.''\r\n",
      "   ``For where there's will, there's women,'' Gorman said. ``And where\r\n",
      "there's women, there's forever a way.''\r\n",
      "   Sunday's event marked the first mayoral inauguration in Los Angeles in\r\n",
      "nearly a decade, with outgoing mayor Eric Garcetti holding the post since 2013.\r\n",
      "   Bass defeated developer Rick Caruso on Nov. 8 in an expensive and at-\r\n",
      "times contentious race.\r\n",
      "   She will inherit leadership of a city grappling with a scandal that\r\n",
      "has embroiled City Hall for the past two months, after three council members\r\n",
      "and a top county labor official took part in a recorded conversation in October\r\n",
      "2021 that included racist comments and attempts to manipulate redistricting.\r\n",
      "   The fallout has continued to roil City Hall, with Councilman Kevin de\r\n",
      "León -- one of the participants in the conversation -- unexpectedly returning\r\n",
      "to the chamber on Friday, setting off chaos as he continues to defy calls to\r\n",
      "resign. De León later fought with an activist at a holiday tree lighting event\r\n",
      "on Friday evening.\r\n",
      "   City Council President Paul Krekorian, who swore in five new city\r\n",
      "council members and a new city attorney and city controller at Sunday's\r\n",
      "ceremony, said that there is no leader more capable of bringing the city\r\n",
      "together than Bass.\r\n",
      "   ``This is a time of unprecedented challenges in our city, but today as\r\n",
      "I look out at this audience and see the people with us, I know that this is\r\n",
      "also a time of unprecedented opportunity,'' Krekorian said.\r\n",
      "   Krekorian added that Bass will have a ``very strong part in the Los\r\n",
      "Angeles City Council,'' a positive sign for Bass -- who will need to have the\r\n",
      "council renew her state of emergency for homelessness every month.\r\n",
      "   Bass, 69, grew up in the midst of the civil rights movement with three\r\n",
      "brothers in the Venice and Fairfax neighborhoods. She was drawn to\r\n",
      "community activism after watching the movement on television, volunteering for\r\n",
      "Robert F. Kennedy's 1968 presidential campaign when she was 14. Bass said while\r\n",
      "her parents did not live to see her take elected office, ``their love, support\r\n",
      "and guidance is why I stand before you today.''\r\n",
      "   Bass' father fled the Jim Crow south during the great African American\r\n",
      "migration after World War II and found work as a letter carrier. His\r\n",
      "paycheck supported Bass and her siblings, and allowed her mother to choose to\r\n",
      "be a homemaker.\r\n",
      "   ``When I think about the dreams of working people today, I reflect on\r\n",
      "the fact that my mother and father were able to buy a home in Los Angeles for\r\n",
      "their family of six with one paycheck,'' Bass said.\r\n",
      "   Bass' organizing career began in 1990 when she founded Community\r\n",
      "Coalition, a South Los Angeles social justice group in response to the crack\r\n",
      "cocaine crisis. In 2004, Bass was the only Black woman in the state Legislature\r\n",
      "when she was elected to the Assembly. Four years later, she became the first\r\n",
      "Black woman to lead the chamber. Bass was elected to the U.S. House of\r\n",
      "Representatives in 2010 and chaired the Congressional Black Caucus in 2019 and\r\n",
      "2020.\r\n",
      "   State Senate President pro-Tempore Toni Atkins said that Bass didn't\r\n",
      "run for mayor for ``credit or photo-opps.''\r\n",
      "   ``She is here to work,'' Atkins said. ``She is here because she loves\r\n",
      "this city, she loves its people. She is here to answer the call to serve. And\r\n",
      "that is who she is.''\r\n",
      "   The new mayor called for the city to focus on solutions rather than\r\n",
      "jurisdiction, to link arms rather than point fingers.\r\n",
      "   ``If we just focus on bringing people inside, comprehensively\r\n",
      "addressing their needs, and moving them to permanent housing with a way to pay\r\n",
      "their bills, we will save lives and save our city,'' Bass said. ``That is my\r\n",
      "mission as your mayor.''\r\n",
      "   Bass said her father taught her to be a critical thinker, and to\r\n",
      "understand the historical context of national and international events.\r\n",
      "   ``My daily conversations with him led me to make a lifetime commitment\r\n",
      "to do whatever I can to change the world,'' she said.\r\n",
      "   Through the ``unaffordability, the difficulty, the struggle working\r\n",
      "people face today in Los Angeles,'' Bass said that Angelenos have ``never, ever\r\n",
      "given up.''\r\n",
      "   ``And our magic, L.A. magic, it's still here,'' she said.\r\n",

The sentence is the result of Avenatti's conviction on charges related to his extortion of Nike and defrauding of his former client Stormy Daniels and other clients. The sentence is longer than the five years requested by prosecutors and the 12 months requested by Avenatti's lawyers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Avenatti, a 51-year-old Newport Beach attorney, was convicted in February of all three counts he faced: honest services wire fraud, extortion and transmission of interstate communications with intent to extort. He was found guilty of attempting to extort Nike for at least $85 million and defrauding Daniels of about $300,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the sentencing hearing in Santa Ana, Selna said Avenatti had committed \"a very serious offense\" and that \"a substantial term of imprisonment is required.\" He imposed a sentence of 14 years in prison, followed by five years of supervised release.\n",
      "\n",
      "Avenatti had already been sentenced in the Nike case in New York to three years in prison and in the Daniels case in California to 17 1/2 years, but Selna said he would run the sentences concurrently. This means Avenatti will only serve 14 years, rather than the combined total of about 19 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to the prison sentence, Selna ordered Avenatti to pay restitution of $10,810,709 to victims in four separate cases, including the IRS. Avenatti was also ordered to pay a $250,000 fine and to forfeit $2.75 million.\n",

U.S. District Judge Brett Sagel had ordered him to stay in the Southern District of New York, but Avenatti had gone to California.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the sentencing hearing, Avenatti's lawyer, Alexis Gardner, compared Avenatti to David, the biblical figure who fought Goliath. She said Avenatti had taken on \"some of the most powerful Goliaths in the world,\" including Donald Trump and Nike.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gardner said Avenatti had been punished enough by the time he'd already served in jail and by the \"public humiliation\" he had suffered. She asked Selna to sentence Avenatti to only six years in prison.\n",
